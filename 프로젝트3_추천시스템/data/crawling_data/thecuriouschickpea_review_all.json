				"1. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. In a second small mixing bowl combine the yogurt, melted vegan butter (or coconut oil), and warm water until smooth. Add the wet to the dry and combine with a wooden spoon to form a wet dough.",
				"2. Knead with your hands for about 1-2 minutes. The dough will be very sticky, if it feels soupy, add a bit more flour until it's sticky but not runny. Otherwise, you can wet your hands to prevent the dough from sticking too much.",
				"3. Shape the kneaded dough into a ball and turn seam-side down. Cover the bowl and place it in a warm spot. Let the dough rise 45 minutes or until swollen 1 1/2 - 2x in size. Alternatively, refrigerate the dough after kneading in a covered mixing bowl and continue 8-48 hours later.",
				"4. Dust a clean counter with flour and turn the proved dough out. Divide the dough into 4 to 8 equal pieces and shape into balls, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Set the dough balls on a floured plate, and sprinkle more flour on top. Cover with a lint free towel and let rise while the oven preheats.",
				"5. Preheat the oven to 550 \u00baF, or as hot as your oven goes with a rack positioned 1/3 of the way down from the top of the oven. If you have one, place a baking steel or baking stone on that rack to preheat. Let the oven preheat for at least 45 minutes to saturate the sides and baking steel or stone (if using) with heat.",
				"6. After the second rise, roll the dough with a rolling pin to shape into an oval. To make a teardrop shape grab one side of the oval and stretch it to make a triangular shape.",
				"7. Brush the top of the shaped breads with melted butter (or coconut oil) and sprinkle on minced garlic if making garlic naan.",
				"8. Bake the naan 2-3 at a time, either on a parchment lined baking tray or directly on a baking stone or steel. If baking on the stone or steel transfer using a pizza peel.",
				"9. Bake for 3-5 minutes until there are some golden spots on the bubbled surface. If desired, turn on the broiler for 1-2 minutes after 3-4 minutes of baking. Larger naan will take longer to cook, smaller ones will cook faster, keep an eye on the first batch and adjust cooking times accordingly.",
				"10. Repeat with remaining dough. For restaurant style presentation, brush the hot dough with some more vegan butter, the butter will melt on contact. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve."

				"1. In the bowl of a stand mixer or bread machine combine the all purpose and bread flours, sugar, salt, and instant yeast (see note below if using active dry yeast).",
				"2. Blend the silken tofu, plant milk, and vinegar together with a stick blender or upright blender until smooth. Add this to the dry ingredients and mix together with a wooden spoon until the dough is shaggy.",
				"3. Using the dough hook on the stand mixer knead the dough on low speed for 5 minutes to begin developing the dough. If using a bread machine, set it on the dough cycle and begin adding the vegan butter after 5 minutes of kneading.",
				"4. Slowly add the vegan butter while the mixer is on, just a couple tablespoons at a time. You may need to pause occasionally to scrape down the sides or push the soft butter into the dough manually. It can take up to 10 minutes to incorporate all of the butter.",
				"5. Once the butter has been kneaded in, let the mixer continue to knead for another 15-20 minutes to develop the dough. The silken tofu prevents you from being able to thinly stretch the dough into a window pane, but you will still see a smoother texture from the dough as it kneads.",
				"6. Turn the kneaded dough into a lightly oiled mixing bowl and turn the dough to coat in oil. Cover the bowl and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour, at which point it will be puffy and increased about 50% in size.",
				"7. Place the dough in the fridge and refrigerate for at least 4 hours but ideally overnight or up to 1 day.",
				"8. Grease two standard loaf pans (8.5 x 4.5 inches) with vegan butter. You can also use 9\"x5\" loaf pans.",
				"9. Take the refrigerated dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces to make 2 loaves of bread. Shape each piece of dough into your desired shape (see post for more details).",
				"10. To make a braid: Divide the dough into three equal pieces and roll out until about 14 inches long. Arrange the ropes parallel to each other and starting about 1/3 of the way down from the top start braiding the dough. When you reach the end pinch the pieces together. Then braid the top part of the dough, you will have to braid in the opposite way to match the lower half. Pinch the top ends together, then tuck both ends under the bread. Gently transfer the braid into the greased pan.To make a segmented bread: Divide the dough into six equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a rectangle, then fold the short ends in like a letter. Flatten the dough to a rectangle once again (about as wide as the loaf pan) then roll the dough from the short end to make a log. Place each segment into the loaf pan seam side down, squishing them flatter to fit.",
				"11. Cover the loaves with plastic wrap and let rise until about 1.5x as large, or the dough almost reaches the top of the pan. This will take 1-3 hours depending on ambient temperature.",
				"12. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00baF.",
				"13. When the loaves have risen, optionally brush them with the vegan egg wash. This is most appropriate for sweet or neutral applications, skip for a savory dish. Mix together the plant milk, syrup, and cornstarch, then brush over the top of the proved loaves.",
				"14. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden and the center reaches 180-190 \u00baF.",
				"15. Remove the loaves immediately from the pans and let cool on a wire rack for a minimum of 20 minutes before slicing into."

				"2. In a large mixing bowl beat your vegan butter with an electric mixer until it is fluffy and creamy. Then add the sugar, aquafaba, molasses, and orange zest and beat the mixture again until everything is creamed and fluffy, this can take a few minutes.",
				"3. In a separate mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt to combine. Then, add the dry ingredients to the wet and using electric beaters, mix until a smooth dough forms.",
				"4. Shape the dough into a thick disk. If making the dough in advance: wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours, then roll out between two sheets of parchment paper to 3/16 - 1/8\" thickTo bake right away: place the disk of dough between two large sheets of parchment paper and use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to 3/16 - 1/8\" thick. Transfer the rolled dough onto a flat baking sheet and then place it in the freezer for 15 minutes to firm up or in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
				"5. Use a star shaped cookie cutter (about 3 inches from point to point) to cut shapes out of the rolled dough. Place the cut out cookies onto an ungreased baking sheet leaving about 1/2-inch between the closest points of each cookie.",
				"6. Take the scraps and re-roll and cut as necessary, freezing for 5-10 minutes if the dough becomes too soft making it difficult to cut and transfer the shapes.",
				"7. Bake the cookies at 375 \u00baF for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are just a shade darker but not browned. Let them cool on the baking trays for 3-5 minutes then transfer to a cookie sheet to cool completely. If baking more than one tray at a time, place one on a rack just one spot above center and one on a rack one spot lower than center and switch the trays halfway through baking.",
				"8. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the sifted powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and plant milk with a fork or small whisk. The icing should be stiff enough that when you run a spoon through it, it separates and takes a moment before it runs to fill in the line. And, it should be thin enough that it will run easily off a fork or a spoon, but not immediately lose its shape and settling back into the rest of the icing. If needed, add a little more powdered sugar or milk until you reach the desired consistency.",
				"9. Decorate the cookies with a piping bag and a tip with a very small hole, or just spread some on each cookie with a knife."

Bake for 10 minutes, then flip and bake an additional 6-10 minutes until golden and cripsy on each side.To fry: test that the oil is hot, it should be 350 \u00baF if checking with a thermometer, or you can test with a small piece of tempeh: the oil should bubble/boil vigorously around it and the piece of tempeh should float to the surface fairly quickly after being dropped in. When the oil is heated, fry in batches, 1-2 minutes on each side, until the wings are a rich golden brown. Remove from oil and place on a paper towel lined plate.",

If the mixture is sticky add flour until it no longer sticks to your hand. If you can't get the flour to fully absorb and mix into the potatoes add a little extra olive oil until it comes together. The key is to not have a wet and sticky dough so that it's easy to work with and form into little dumplings.",
				"3. Keeping the dough covered so it doesn't dry out, take a small section at a time to form into the gnocchi. Take a 1 tsp (~6g) piece of dough and squeeze it in your fist to make a compact and roughly shaped ball, then roll it between your palms to make it round.",
				"4. For the traditional gnocchi shape with the grooves on one side, place a fork sitting face down on the counter and take the ball and place it at the top of the backside of the tines of the fork. With your thumb on the piece of dough, slide the gnocchi down the tines of the fork until you reach the counter. The gnocchi will turn under your thumb until it has grooves going around about 3/4 of the dough and a small inset divot where your thumb was.",
				"5. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. If the dough becomes sticky at any point, toss shaped gnocchi with flour so they don't stick together and knead a bit of extra flour into the remaining unshaped dough.",
				"6. To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add half the gnocchi to the pot and let it cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until the gnocchi float to the top and have cooked an additional minute at the top. Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon and then cook the second batch of gnocchi.",

To bake the samosa: Brush each samosa with oil, then bake at 400\u00baF for 10 minutes, flip and bake another 5-8 minutes until golden and edges are crispy.To fry the samosa: Heat at least 2\" of oil to 325 \u00baF (or use a deep fryer). Fry the samosa in batches to not overcrowd. Fry each batch of samosa for about 4 minutes, or until golden and the pastry is covered in small bubbles. Let drain on a paper towel lined plate or on a cooling rack.Enjoy your samosa warm and with a side of chutney!"

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and knead by hand around 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add flour if necessary, though give it a minute before adding as it takes time for the flour to absorb the moisture. You should have a soft and lightly tacky dough (not sticky).

When cool enough to handle, cut grilled eggplant into ~3/4\" cubes",

				"6. Toss the eggplant in the sauce.",
				"7. Punch down the dough and divide into 12 (~54 g) balls of dough. Let rest a few minutes before shaping so the gluten has a chance to relax.",
				"8. Prepare your steaming apparatus and bring water to a boil. Line the steamer with parchment to prevent sticking and/or cut 12 ~2.5\" squares of parchment paper to use with each bun.",
				"9. Pat or roll out each piece of dough into a ~5\" round. Place in your non-dominant hand, and a heaping tablespoon of the eggplant to the center. Take opposing sides of the dough and pinch together over the filling with your thumb and forefinger. Repeat pinching the dough together as you go around the bun until all of the dough meets in the center. Pinch and twist the top to seal it off. Place the bun on a piece of parchment paper and repeat with the remaining dough.",

				"1. Measure out the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add in the salt and stir to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let sit for a couple of minutes to hydrate and dissolve, then stir to distribute.",
				"2. Add the flour into the mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until you form a shaggy dough. Switch to using your hands. Wet your hands to prevent the dough from sticking to them and pinch the dough into several segments between your first finger and thumb. Then reach under the edges of the dough and gently pull it up to stretch the dough until you hit resistance, then fold the section of dough over to rest of the dough. Turn the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat the pulling and folding until you've gone all around. This action brings the dough back into one piece. Repeat the pinching and folding process for about 1-2 minutes until your dough starts to turn into a cohesive, but sticky ball of dough. Re-wet your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking to them. Cover the bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.",
				"3. After the 20 minutes of rest, turn the dough onto a clean and floured surface. Knead the dough for about 1 minute until you get a smooth ball of dough. Flour your hands and add flour to the counter as necessary to prevent sticking. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil and place the ball of dough mixing bowl, turning to coat in oil before leaving seam side down. Cover the mixing bowl and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, until it's doubled in size. You can let it rise for up to 2 hours before shaping.",
				"4. Turn the dough onto a clean, floured counter and stretch to make a large rectangle. You're going to divide the dough into 2 or 3 pieces (depending on the size you want your final pizza to be) by sprinkling flour over where you're going to cut (this prevents it from sticking) and cut into the sections with a bench scraper, or with a butter knife by pressing straight down into the dough.",
				"5. Shape the dough one piece at a time. To shape the dough, you will use the same folding technique as before (this time with dry or lightly floured hands). Take a section of the dough and gently stretch it up until you feel resistance, then fold over the middle. Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball. Then, turn the ball of dough and place seam side down on a clean, un-floured section of the counter. Cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Repeat with the remaining sections of dough, then place on a floured plate. Sprinkle more flour on top of the dough, then cover with plastic wrap and place the plate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, or up to 72 hours, before making pizza.",
				"6. Before shaping the dough and baking, let come to room temperature and relax for about 1 hour. If you try to shape the dough and it's not stretching out easily or quickly, let it rest for 10 minutes then try again."

				"1. Turn the oven to 550 \u00baF, or as hot as it will go. Place a rack one third of the way down from the top of the oven, and place a baking steel or baking stone on that rack. You want the oven to saturate with heat for about 1 hour before baking pizza for best results.",

				"3. Make the sauce: in a blender combine a couple spoonfuls of the tomatoes and their juices with everything else (olive oil, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt) and blend until smooth. Add the rest of the tomatoes and pulse a couple of times.",
				"4. Cook the garlic scapes: heat a large skillet over medium. Add the oil and garlic scapes along with a pinch of salt. Fry until the garlic scapes are a couple shades more vibrant and charred in a few spots. Remove from heat.",
				"5. Fry the vegan sausage: Leave the skillet on and add a little more oil (if needed). Fry the sausage until it is browned, then remove from heat and slice when it has cooled enough to touch.",
				"6. When the oven has preheated for about an hour, prepare your pizzas one at a time. Stretch your dough to around 10-12\" diameter and place on a lightly floured pizza peel.",
				"7. Spread the sauce over the dough then top with vegan mozzarella, vegan sausage, dollops of Calabrian chiles, and about 4 garlic scapes.",
				"8. Transfer the pizza onto the baking steel or pizza stone and bake for about 8 minutes. If needed, turn the heat to broil for another 1-2 minutes to brown the top. Alternatively, bake on a baking sheet: assemble the pizza straight on the pan and place directly in the oven to bake. Ideally the pan is on a baking stone or steel.",
				"9. Repeat the pizza assembly and baking with the remaining dough.",
				"10. Top the pizza with fresh basil, vegan parmesan (optional), and fresh or dried oregano, and cut into it once it's cooled for a couple of minutes. Best enjoyed while hot!"

			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF with a rack positioned in the center. Prepare two 8\" round pans: spray the pans with oil, then place round parchment paper on the bottom.",
				"2. In a large mixing bowl add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Whisk together until combined and fluffy.",
				"3. In a second mixing bowl add the oil, maple syrup, plant milk, vanilla extract, chocolate extract (if using), and apple cider vinegar. Whisk together. Add the wet ingredients to the dry whisk until smooth and lump free.",
				"4. Divide the batter into the prepared baking pans then tap the pans on the counter 2-3 times to release some of the air bubbles. Place the pans in the center of the oven and bake for 32-34 minutes. When done, a tester will come out clean or with a couple of crumbs and the edges of the cake will have pulled away from the edge of the pan.",
				"5. Place the pan on a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to fully cool. Remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake when transferring.",
				"6. When cool, move the cake onto a cardboard round and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Store this in the fridge until chilled.",
				"7. Combine the blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and dried lavender in a pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, mashing the berries to break them up. Then turn down and let simmer for about 15 minutes (may take less time if using fresh berries), or until a spoon can run through the pot and the jam takes a second before filling in behind it. Let cool completely, or make in advance and refrigerate until ready to use.",
				"8. Whisk together the flour and plant milk in a small pot until smooth. Turn the heat on to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer. Keep whisking continuously until the pudding thickens. Turn off the heat and let cool to room temperature. Whisk occasionally as it cools to keep it smooth.",
				"9. Blitz the sugar in a blender for a few seconds to make a superfine sugar.",
				"10. In a large mixing bowl with electric beaters or using a stand mixer with paddle attachment, whip the vegan butter and sugar until fluffy.",
				"11. Add the pudding in batches, whipping after each one to incorporate. Once all of it has been added, whip the frosting until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and beat it in.",
				"12. If making frosting in advance, store in fridge or freezer, and let come completely to room temperature before re-whipping.",
				"13. Cut each cake layer in half using a cake leveler or a long serrated bread knife (see post for tips).",
				"14. Layer the cakes. Place a cake layer down, spread about 1/4 of the frosting over it. Spoon some blackberry lavender jam on top and use the back of a spoon to swirl it into the frosting. Add fresh black berries (cut in half or use smaller berries) if you'd like. Repeat with the remaining layers.",
				"15. After adding the last layer, frost the top with the remaining buttercream and swirl in some blackberry lavender jam to marble the top. Decorate with fresh berries and flowers if you'd like.",
				"16. Refrigerate the cake to store (cover or wrap in plastic once chilled--frosting will firm when cold), but serve at room temperature!"

Pour it over the blender or food processor, including the blades, lid, and tamper stick--anything that will touch the cashew cheese. Pour it over the measuring cups, the silicon spatula (ideally with a wooden or silicon handle), and the glass bowl you will culture in, including its lid if it has one. Pour off the boiling hot water once it's rinsed and scalded every surface and let the steam mostly evaporate (its ok if a little water is left behind). Be careful not to burn yourself with the water when you do this.",

			"time": "1 hour 25 minutes",

				"1. Prepare the dumpling dough: in a stand mixer bowl combine the flour, salt, oil, and boiling hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine bring into a rough dough. Using the dough hook on a stand mixer knead on low speed for 3 minutes, turn off and let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 3 minutes on low speed. ",
				"2. Turn out onto the counter and knead by hand for about 1 minute and make any last adjustments with flour or water to make a smooth and supple dough that's slightly tacky (but not sticky) to the touch. Cover with a damp towel and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes while you prepare the filling. Alternatively you can knead by hand, just let the dough cool enough to not burn your hands and follow the same knead 3m, rest 5m, knead 3m pattern, making adjustments with flour as you knead.",
				"3. Prepare the filling: Heat a skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and add the tofu. Fry for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cabbage, green onion, garlic, plus a pinch of salt and let cook 5-6 minutes until the cabbage has released its water and the mixture has cooked down.",
				"4. In a small mixing bowl, mix together the gochujang paste, hot water, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce to form a smooth sauce. Add the sauce to the tofu mixture along with the cilantro, stir to combine then turn off the heat and let cool to room temperature. You can transfer to a plate and put in fridge to speed up the process.",
				"5. Fill and shape the dumplings: Divide the rested dumpling dough into 32 pieces: cut in half, then each half into quarters, and each quarter into quarters to get 32. Keep them covered under the damp towel in the bowl, working with just a few at a time.",
				"6. Lightly dust the counter and roll out each piece of dough individually to make a thin circle, about the size of your palm. Using your finger or a pastry brush, brush a little water just around the edge of the circle, about 1cm thick. Put the wrapper in one hand, and place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of the wrapper. With your other hand fold the wrapper in half and pinch in the center so it seals, then working towards the edge, pleat one side and press to seal against the opposite side, then work down the other side. You can also create folds starting from one edge and working to the others so that all the pleats fold in the same direction, but this method is a bit more challenging for a beginner. Set aside onto a piece of parchment paper and repeat with remaining pieces of dough.",
				"7. When the dumplings are all shaped, put a thin layer of water in a bowl and pour sesame seeds to cover a small plate. Dip the dumplings in the water then dip into the sesame seeds (this step is optional) and return to the parchment paper.",
				"8. Cook the dumplings: heat a skillet over medium heat. Add a tablespoon or so of oil to coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Add dumplings in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Let cook for about 2 minutes, then add 1/4 cup of water (be careful of splattering, hold a lid up to protect you as you pour) and immediately cover the skillet. Let steam for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and if the bottoms are still too light in color, let them continue to cook until golden.",

Bake on the center rack of the oven for 18-20 minutes or until the muffins have pulled away from the edge of the tin (if not using a liner). You can also test with a toothpick or a cake tester, but the chocolate chunks in the batter will make it hard to tell if it's done. A tester might pull out with some melted chocolate on it, but no wet batter and only a few crumbs should cling to it when done.",

Rinse your blender with boiling hot water as well as a glass or ceramic mixing bowl to culture the cheese, any measuring cups, and your spatula. No metal should come in contact with the mixture after the probiotics have been added, so get a silicon spatula or wooden spoon for stirring and sanitize that as well.",

Transfer the mixture to a sanitized large glass or ceramic bowl (as metal can inhibit the culturing) and empty out 6 probiotic capsules into the cashew mixture. Stir these in with a sanitized wooden or silicon spoon and cover the mixture. Let it culture at room temperature for 24-36 hours, stirring once or twice part way throughout and tasting it as it cultures. When it reaches your desired level of tangy and sourness, put the mixture in the fridge to stop the culturing process. How long the mixture takes to culture can depend on the ambient temperature of your room.",
				"3. Rub the inside of a fondue pot or a pot on the stove with the cut clove of garlic and discard the garlic. Transfer the cultured cheese into a fondue pot or into a pot on the stove. Mix the tapioca starch in the 2 tablespoons of water to create a slurry and add that to the cheese along with the white wine and the nutmeg.",
				"4. Heat the fondue pot, or heat over the stove on low heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture is hot and bubbly. The cheese sauce will become thick and stretchy as the tapioca starch activates.",

Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl and whip the ganache until light and fluffy. This will take 2-5 minutes depending on your machine! Use immediately to decorate your cakes. If the ganache gets too runny it probably wasn't chilled enough and put it back in the fridge until ready."

If making the zucchini bowls, slice off the top of the zucchini and using a small teaspoon scoop out the inside flesh then chop it up, you should end up with at least 1 1/2 cups of squash, 2 or 2 1/2 cups is fine too. If using long thin zucchini, slice in half lengthwise and hollow each half out like a canoe. Set aside.",
				"3. In a large heavy bottomed pot, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium low heat. Add the diced onion and saut\u00e9 for 5-6 minutes, until the onion is soft, translucent, and just starting to brown. Add the garlic and the chopped zucchini and saut\u00e9 another 6-7 minutes until the zucchini is tender.",
				"4. While the zucchini is cooking, add the canned tomatoes to a blender blitz for a few seconds to grind them up into a thick sauce. You can skip this step if you used crushed tomatoes.",
				"5. Add the barley, oregano, sage, thyme, 1 tsp of salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir to coat in oil. Stir in the tomatoes, coconut milk, water, and nutritional yeast and turn the heat up to bring the pot to a low boil. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, particularly towards the end so it doesn't stick to the bottom. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired. When done barley will be completely tender but remain chewy.",
				"6. While the barley risotto is cooking, lightly drizzle or brush olive oil over the insides of the squash and turn them upside down on the greased baking tray.

				"1/4 cup light corn syrup",
				"pinch of salt"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 42 minutes",
			"serving": "~10 cups frosting",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Place the strawberries and sugar in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the heat down to low and let simmer for about 10-12 minutes until thickened and syrupy. Using a fine mesh sieve, strain the sauce so it is smooth, pressing out the remaining pulp to extract the juice. You should end up with about 1 cup of strawberry sauce. Allow to fully cool and chill in the fridge.",
				"2. Whisk together the water and sugar in a small saucepan. Turn the heat on low and cover until the sugar is dissolved.",
				"3. Meanwhile add the reduced and cold aquafaba to the bowl of a stand mixer along with the cream of tartar. Whisk by hand with the whisk attachment until slightly frothy, then hook up and turn the mixer on a medium speed.",
				"4. Back to the sugar syrup, remove the lid (using the lid helps any sugar crystals on the side of the pot dissolve into the mixture) and set up a candy thermometer so it isn't touching the bottom of the pot. Watch the temperature carefully until it gets to 234 \u00baF (112 \u00baC) then turn up the stand mixer to high so that the aquafaba forms stiff peaks. You can turn up the heat to medium if you are careful and keep a close eye on the temperature.",
				"5. As soon as the sugar syrup reaches 248 \u00baF (120 \u00baC) it's ready to be added to the aquafaba meringue. At this point the meringue should have formed stiff peaks, which means that the meringue that clings to the whisk when removed will stay in a thin upright peak when inverted. If you invert the whole bowl over your head it shouldn't slide or budge a centimeter.",
				"6. When the syrup is at the edge of the firm and hard ball stages at 248 \u00baF and the meringue has reached stiff peaks, keep your mixer on high and slowly drizzle in the sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to aim between the whisk and the edge of the bowl to keep the sugar syrup from splattering. Be careful as the sugar syrup is VERY hot. Pour the entire syrup into the meringue. The meringue will increase in size as the syrup is added.",
				"7. When all the syrup is added switch to a paddle attachment and turn it on to high. Let the mixture beat until it has fully cooled down. It should feel cool to the touch. You can speed up this process by placing an ice pack underneath the bowl if the shape of your mixer allows.",
				"8. Do not add the fat before the meringue has COMPLETELY cooled down. Once cool, leave the mixer at a high speed and very slowly add in the fat, just a spoonful at a time, letting it incorporate before adding the next spoon. If you do this slowly and all your ingredients are cold everything should work out fine (note: it's normal to lose volume when you add fat, but it thickens up as more fat is added). However, it can happen that the mixture breaks and looks curdled. Do not give up, keep adding the fat and it should come back together. It may need to be chilled if it doesn't come back together after adding the fat, so stick everything (bowl and paddle attachment) into the fridge to chill for several minutes before trying again.",
				"9. When your buttercream is thick and fluffy and all the fat has been added, turn the speed of the mixer down to medium and while running add in the vanilla extract. Then, with the mixer still running, slowly pour in the strawberry sauce. Start with 3/4 cups of sauce and add more to taste and desired color is reached.",
				"10. At this point the buttercream can be used to frost a cake. If you want the frosting to firm up a little before decorating place in the fridge to chill and firm checking every several minutes. Once it's chilled sufficiently take it out and use to frost chilled cakes.",
				"11. If you want to make the buttercream in advance, you can refrigerate or freeze the frosting before the strawberry sauce is added. Bring the frosting to room temperature and re-fluff with the paddle attachment, then add the strawberry sauce and use immediately.",
				"12. See the post for details on decorating.",
				"13. Add the chopped chocolate to a heat proof bowl. Bring the coconut cream to a simmer over medium heat, then pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then whisk from the center out until completely melted and smooth. Add the corn syrup and a pinch of salt and mix just to combine.",
				"14. Let the chocolate sauce cool until it runs easily and thickly off of a spoon, then pour the chocolate sauce into drips along the edge of the frosted and chilled cake using a spoon. Once you've made all your dips pour additional sauce to cover the top of the cake, spreading using an offset spatula and gently tipping the cake. To make a spiral design: let chocolate cool slightly and firm up, then place the tip of the spatula in the center of the cake and spin the cake slowly around while letting the spatula slide outwards as it rotates.",
				"15. Cut the cake when chilled for cleanest cuts, but serve at or close to room temperature for the best textures."

			"recipe": [
				"1. Turn the oven on to broil and position a rack 6\" from the burner. Place the jalape\u00f1o peppers on a baking sheet under the broiler and roast for about 10 minutes, rotating occasionally, until the skin of the peppers has charred and blackened. Put the jalape\u00f1os in a covered bowl to allow them to steam so the skins loosen. When cool enough to handle peel off the skin, seed (unless you want your dip spicier), and mince.",
				"2. Turn your oven to 350 \u00baF.",
				"3. Heat a large skillet over medium and add the 1 tbsp of oil. Place the cauliflower in a single layer and let cook for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through. The cauliflower should be charred in spots and just slightly fork tender (it should still be rather firm).",
				"4. In a blender add the cashews, garlic, water, coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, tapioca starch, nutritional yeast, salt, onion powder, and smoked paprika. Blend until smooth and creamy, then add the cauliflower. Blend the cauliflower until it is finely riced, or you have your desired texture.",
				"5. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and stir in the minced roasted jalape\u00f1os, the sliced scallions, and the can of diced green chiles. Mix to combine, then pour into a oven safe dish, such as a 9\" cast iron skillet.",
				"6. In a small mixing bowl, stir together all of the breadcrumb topping ingredients and spoon over the dip. If you'd like place a sliced jalape\u00f1o on top of the breadcrumbs.",
				"7. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the bread crumbs are a deep golden brown and the dip has thickened. Let sit for several minutes before digging in.",
				"8. Enjoy with some crostini, toasted baguette, or crackers."

Heat a skillet over medium heat, then add the chickpeas and all the extra sauce. Pan fry for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has absorbed, the chickpeas are starting to char, and some are starting to fall apart from the occasional stirring. If they are not mashing a little, go ahead and mash it up just a tiny bit, leaving most chickpeas whole. Taste and add more salt if desired. Turn off the heat and set aside.",
				"3. Prepare the rice paper rolls: Have all the fillings ready to go and laid out so you can work quickly. Run a dried rice paper wrap under hot water briefly on each side then lay it on a damp wooden cutting board or a slightly damp lint free towel.",
				"4. Arrange slices of avocado in the center of the wrap, then pile on the buffalo chickpeas, shredded collard greens, red bell pepper, and lots of cilantro leaves and scallion greens. Wrap one side of the rice paper over top the filling, then fold in the adjacent sides to cover. Then using both hands, gently roll the rice paper over the filling to form a burrito with the seam sealed. Place on a serving dish and cover with a damp towel to keep fresh.",
				"5. Repeat until all spring rolls have been formed, about 7 or 8 in total. If needed due to a tear, you can always roll in a second rice paper wrap.",
				"6. Serve with the tahini ranch dip and enjoy right away!"

				"2. To make by hand: Turn the dough out onto a clean counter. Knead by hand for 3 minutes. If needed, add a little extra flour (a tablespoon at a time), but expect the dough to start out sticky and get less sticky, turning more tacky, as you knead. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 4-5 minutes until you have a smooth and slightly tacky dough. The dough should be soft and a bit bouncy.",
				"3. If using a stand mixer:  Using the dough hook, knead the dough on low speed for 3 minutes. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then turn the stand mixer back on and knead an additional 3 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead by hand for 1-2 minutes, making any final adjustments to add more flour if needed. The final dough should be soft, bouncy, smooth, and slightly tacky.",
				"4. Place the dough into a lightly oiled large mixing bowl and turn to coat the dough in oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a lightly dampened towel and let rise for 1 hour. The dough should be 1 1/2 to 2x risen in volume.",
				"5. Preheat the oven to 400 \u00baF.",
				"6. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and divide until 8 equal pieces. Form each piece of dough into a ball, rolling the ball seam side down under your palm in small circles to create a taught skin around the ball of dough. Let rest for 5 minutes, then shape the balls into rolls. Roll the ball under your hands to form a torpedo or [American] football shape, 4-5\" long. The edges will be slightly tapered with the center remaining round. Press down the tops of the dough to flatten slightly, so they are about 3/4\" tall. Place the shaped rolls on a parchment lined baking sheet with 1 1/2-2\" between each roll as they will expand in the oven. Lightly mist the tops of the rolls with oil then loosely cover with plastic wrap.",
				"7. Let the dough rise for a second time while the oven preheats. After 20-30 minutes the rolls will have swollen, as much as 50%. At this point they are ready to bake.",
				"8. Brush the tops of the rolls with some plant milk of your choice for a shinier finish. Then using a bread lame or a lightly oiled sharp knife, slash the bread either with one cut down the center length wise or two parallel diagonal lines.",
				"9. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until the loaves are a beautiful golden brown (Note: if you did not use the barley malt the loaves will not darken as much). Let cool completely before consuming."

Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a simmer, lower the heat and cover the pot with the lid ajar. Let the sauce simmer for at least 25-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken. Taste and add the sugar if the sauce is a little tart.",
				"6. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00baF (or just turn it down from roasting the eggplant & garlic).",

In a small food processor add 1 1/2 cups of the cooked lentils, pecans, sun dried tomatoes, the marinara sauce (don't worry if it's still simmering away, it's still good to add!), garlic, onion powder and the flax mixture. Process until it's well combined and somewhat mushy. The mixture shouldn't be a smooth puree, but won't have much texture left. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and add the remaining 1/2 cup of lentils and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. Mix together to form a firm and non-sticky mixture.

				"1. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF and prepare your tartlet pans. If they do not have removable bottoms place two or more strips of parchment, crossed, in each pan. These can be used as handles to gently remove the tart shells once they are baked.",
				"2. In a large mixing bowl sift together the flour and powdered sugar. Add the vegan butter in cubes and use your hands to rub the fat into the flour until the mixture is crumbly and no lumps of butter remain.",
				"3. Continue working the flour mixture to bring it together. It should squeeze together in your hand to form a delicate but pliable dough. If needed, and 1 teaspoon of water at a time, stirring it in with a wooden spoon, until the dough comes together.",
				"4. Take about 1/4 cup of dough to fill a 4\" tartlet pan and press the dough into the pan (overtop the strips of parchment) trying to be as even as possible over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Repeat with the remaining 5 tartlet pans and place all the tarts onto a rimmed baking sheet. Poke the bottom of the tartlets several times with a fork.",
				"5. Take a square of parchment and cover the dough. Pour some dried beans, dried rice, or pie weights over each tartlet.",
				"6. Place the baking tray with the prepared tart shells into the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift away the parchment holding the pie weights. Return the tart shells to the oven and bake another 5 minutes, or until the dough no longer looks raw and is a light golden. Remove from the oven and let cool down completely. The tart shell will remain soft until it cools. Once completely cool remove the shells from the tartlet pans.",
				"7. Make the pastry cream. Place all of the pastry cream ingredients into a blender and blend until completely smooth and creamy.",
				"8. Pour the pastry cream into the cooled tart shells and place the tarts into the fridge for the pastry cream to firm up for at least 30 minutes.",
				"9. When ready, cut the mango to top the pastry cream. Peel the mangoes and cut each side off the pit. To make a rosette, thinly cut the mango width-wise, to make short slices and separate the slices so they are only overlapping about 1/2 to 1/3 of the way. Roll the mangoes in so that the slices wrap around each other to make the rosette. Gently transfer the rosette using a spatula onto the chilled pastry. Lightly press the mango down so it sinks into the pastry cream just a little. Alternatively you can cut the mangoes into slightly thicker slices widthwise and arrange them over the pastry cream as desired.",
				"10. Serve the tarts chilled.",
				"11. To store, keep the tarts tightly wrapped in the fridge and eat within 2 to 3 days. The mangoes will start to discolor if cut too long. You can always wait to add the mango to the pastry filled tart shells until ready to eat."

				"1. First cook the potatoes for the kofta. Peel and cut the potatoes in half, then place them in a pot and cover with water. Place a lid on the pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to medium and let boil for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are fully cooked and easily pierced with a fork. Drain the hot water from the potatoes, mash them until smooth, and set aside.",
				"2. While the potatoes are cooking, start the curry tomato cream sauce. In a large heavy bottomed pot add the onion, canned tomatoes and their juices, cashews, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne, and salt. If you are using fenugreek seeds instead of kasoori methi, also add the fenugreek seeds at this point. Cover the pot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let simmer covered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
				"3. Transfer the onion and tomato mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, making sure to vent so hot air doesn't build up in the blender. Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender, but the final sauce will not be as silky smooth. Pour the creamy mixture back into the pot and add the coconut milk, reserving ~1/4 cup back to serve and crush the methi in your fingers and add to the pot. Mix together and cover the pot and set aside until the kofta are ready.",
				"4. In a large mixing bowl, mash the tofu by squeezing it in your hands until it's creamy and no chunks remain. You want to have the texture of ricotta. Alternatively you can blend it in a small food processor until smooth.",
				"5. Add the mashed potatoes to the mashed tofu along with the corn starch, minced cilantro, lemon juice, garam masala, and salt. Mix together and test the consistency by forming some into a ball. It should hold together. It can stick to your hands a little, but if it is very sticky or too wet and falling apart, you can add a bit more corn starch. This can vary depending on what brand and variety of tofu you use, but the recipe is quite flexible. Mix in the frozen peas. Shape the kofta mixture into heaping 1 tablespoon portions and roll into balls or into a football shape (a torpedo).",
				"6. To fry the kofta: Heat about 2-inches of high heat safe oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Test the oil either with a thermometer until it is 325-350 \u00baF or you can test with a small piece of the kofta mixture: the oil should bubble/boil vigorously around it and the kofta should float to the surface fairly quickly after being dropped in. When the oil is heated fry the shaped kofta in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, until the kofta is a beautiful dark golden brown color, flipping halfway through for even cooking. This should take 5-10 minutes, depending on the temperature of your oil, how much oil you have heated (more oil means the temperature is more stable when you add the kofta), and how many kofta you add at once. When the kofta are cooked, transfer to a paper towel lined plate with a wire spider strainer. Repeat with remaining batched of kofta until all are cooked.",
				"7. To bake the kofta: Preheat the oven to 425 \u00baF. Line a baking tray with parchement and spray or brush with oil. Arrange the shaped kofta onto the baking tray so there is 1/2-1\" between each kofta. Spray or brush the tops with oil. Bake for 30-40 minutes, flipping after the first 15-20 minutes, until both sides are golden and the edges of the kofta are crispy and chewy. It's normal for the kofta to lose their shape a little and flatten when baked.",
				"8. When ready to serve, pour the sauce overtop the kofta (only use what you will eat in one sitting, as the kofta get soggy once in the sauce), then pour the reserved coconut milk over top the kofta. Garnish with cilantro if desired. Enjoy with Indian flatbread and/or basmati rice."

				"1/8 tsp fine sea salt",
				"1 tsp (5mL) vanilla extract",

				"ground hazelnuts, for melted chocolate finish option or a dusting finish on the tempered chocolate",
				"56-60 whole toasted hazelnuts (optional)",
				"flaked salt, such as Maldon sea salt, for tempered chocolate finish option (optional)"
			],
			"time": "4 hours 35 minutes",
			"serving": "56-60 small truffles",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Finely chop the 8oz of chocolate and place in a heat proof bowl.",
				"2. In a small pot bring the hazelnut milk, sugar, and salt to a simmer. Whisk a couple of times as it heats to dissolve the sugar.",
				"3. Once simmering, remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Rotate the bowl to swirl the milk and submerge the chocolate. Cover the bowl with a plate or lid and let sit undisturbed for 4-5 minutes.",
				"4. At this point the chocolate should be warm and melty. Add the vanilla extract and the olive oil, then whisk the chocolate, until the mixture is smooth. Start in the center and work out towards the edges as the chocolate melts and the ganache forms.",
				"5. Test the ganache for texture by dipping a small spoon into the melty ganache, then placing it in the fridge on a small plate. After 15 minutes the ganache should be firm and creamy. If it is too hard, you can whisk in an additional couple teaspoons of hazelnut milk.",
				"6. Pour the ganache into a 9\" baking dish or pyrex storage container (line the bottom with parchment or plastic wrap if you want to make rectangular truffles). Let the ganache cool to room temperature, then place it in the fridge uncovered. Let the ganache chill until the top is firm to the touch, then cover with plastic wrap or parchment so that it is touching the top of the ganache. Let the ganache firm up in the fridge for at least 3 hours, or overnight. It can last in the fridge for up to 1 week.",
				"7. When ready to shape the truffle centers, prepare a rimmed baking sheet or shallow baking dish by lining with parchment paper. Use a small 1/2-tablespoon scoop to make uniform truffles, or use a heaping teaspoon or eyeball 3/4\" rounds and scoop with a small spoon. If desired, place a single toasted hazelnut inside the ganache, pushing it in, then manipulating the soft ganache to cover the hazelnut. Regardless, roll each scoop between the palms of your hand to form a sphere. Don't worry about it being perfectly round. Wash the chocolate off your palms as necessary to prevent sticking. Shape the ganache with dry hands. If the ganache gets to warm to shape, stick it in the refrigerator or freezer until it's firmed up again.",
				"8. If shaping into rectangles, remove the ganache from the container and place on a cutting board. Put a mug filled with hot water next to your work station, and a paper towel or kitchen towel next to you. Warm a sharp knife in the hot water, then dry with the towel. Cut the ganache into your desired shapes, warming the knife as needed between cuts.",
				"9. Set each truffle center on the parchment paper, covering with parchment paper and adding layers of truffles as necessary until all centers are shaped. Place in the fridge to firm up for at least 20 minutes before coating with your choice of chocolate finish, or up to overnight. You can also freeze them for longer, but move to the refrigerator at least 4 hours before dipping in the chocolate finish.",
				"10. Melt the chocolate using a water bath technique or in the microwave. To use a water bath, bring a small pot of water to a low simmer and place a heat proof bowl over top the pot. The bottom of the bowl should NOT be touching the water or the chocolate can burn. Let the chocolate start to look melty, then stir with a silicon spatula. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is fully melted. Remove from the heat and set up your work station.",
				"11. Have the chocolate centers on the parchment paper next to the bowl of melted chocolate. On a plate spread a layer of ground hazelnuts for coating.",
				"12. Using a chocolate dipping tool or a fork, dip each ganache center into the melted chocolate, rolling around to fully coat, then place on plate and roll in ground hazelnuts to coat. Place the truffle back onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with each center until you've finished all of them. Place in the fridge to firm up. Keep these truffles stored in a sealed container in the fridge, but you can remove them an hour before serving so they are not cold.",
				"13. Remove your ganache centers from the refrigerator and temper the chocolate.",
				"14. First, reserve one good-sized chunk (~1 1/2 - 2\") of chocolate from your 12oz of chocolate. Finely chop the remaining chocolate and place in a heat proof bowl.",
				"15. Bring a small amount of water to a simmer over low heat and place the bowl of chocolate over the pot. The bowl of chocolate should NOT touch the water or the chocolate can burn.*IMPORTANT: make sure that no water touches the melted chocolate or the chocolate will seize and you will NOT be able to temper it.",
				"16. Warm the chocolate over the water bath, whisking occasionally, until melted. It should be 100-110 \u00baF. Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and let cool to the low 80-degrees F, whisking regularly to encourage crystallization. When the temperature reaches the low 80s F, add the reserved chunk of chocolate and bring the melted chocolate back up to 88-90 \u00baF. To do this, place it over the barely simmering pot of water for a few seconds, then remove and whisk vigorously. Check the temperature and repeat as necessary until you've reached the 88 \u00baF. Be very careful and slow here so you do not jump back up to over 91 \u00baF and lose your tempering. If that happens, let the mixture cool back down, re-seed with another chunk of chocolate and try again.",
				"17. Once you've reached that 88-90 \u00baF, check that the chocolate is tempered. Smear a small amount of the chocolate on a plate and it should harden and turn shiny within a few minutes.",
				"18. Keep the chocolate between this 88-90 \u00baF range and dip the truffle centers in the chocolate. It's easiest to work with the chocolate dipping forks. Dip the ganache center in, rolling to fully coat, then pull up and let some chocolate drip down, then wipe off the bottom of the fork on the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate before transferring to the parchment lined tray. Immediately sprinkle with ground nuts or a couple of flakes of salt for garnish. Alternatively, you can use a piping bag with a tiny hole to drizzle a little tempered chocolate over top all of them once finished.",
				"19. Keep the tempered chocolate off the heat while you continue to dip the truffles. Check the temperature as you go, and if it starts to cool off much under 88\u00baF, place it back on the warm bowl of water just for a few seconds, whisk and recheck the temperature. If you leave the bowl of chocolate over the hot water, it may get too hot and you will need to re-temper.",
				"20. Any extra tempered chocolate can be spread into a mold, or poured over a piece of parchment paper and allowed to harden. It can just be enjoyed as you would a chocolate bar!",
				"21. Let the chocolate truffles set at room temperature, or speed the process by putting in the fridge for a few minutes. These truffles can be stored at room temperature. Note that if you used the flaked salt to decorate the truffles, over the course of a couple of days, the salt may pull moisture from the air and chocolate and the salt can look melty. This is especially true if it is very humid out."

If you choose not to soak your beans, oven cooking time can be expected to increase.",
				"2. Preheat the oven to 300 \u00baF. If beans have been soaked, drain and rinse them. Put the beans in a large, oven safe, dutch oven. Cover with 8 cups of water, add 1 tsp of finely ground salt, 2 bay leaves, and the epazote or Mexican oregano. Bring the pot to a boil on the stovetop, then transfer the covered pot to the 300 \u00baF oven.",
				"3. Prepare the head of garlic for roasting. Peel off the excess paper around the garlic, and slice off a small portion of the top to expose the cloves. Place the head of garlic in a small piece of foil and pour 1 tsp of oil overtop. Close the foil around the head of garlic and place it in the oven with the pot.",
				"4. Let the beans cook and the garlic roast for 75 minutes. After 75 minutes remove the head of garlic, which should be soft and well roasted at this point. Open up the foil packet, and set the roasted garlic aside to cool. Test the beans for doneness. They should be soft and easily squished by your tongue. If they are firm, continue baking them, checking every 10-15 minutes, until they are tender.",
				"5. When the beans are cooked, return the pot to the stove and turn the heat to medium or medium-low to maintain an active simmer. When the roasted garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and add them all to the pot of beans along with the canned tomatoes with green chile. Let the beans simmer until the liquid is thickened and turning creamy and the beans are soft and practically melt in your mouth, usually 20-25m. Stir the beans occasionally while it cooks so none stick to the bottom. If the mixture gets too dry you can add a little more water as needed",
				"6. Heat a skillet over medium, add 1 tbsp of oil and the diced onion. Fry the onion for 6-8 minutes until soft and golden. Add to the onions to the thickened beans and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Taste the beans and adjust for salt.",

				"1. In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Stir to combine, then add the water. Mix with a wooden spoon to form a shaggy dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface then knead for 3-5 minutes until a soft and supple dough forms. Add more flour to the counter as necessary to prevent sticking and to get the correct texture. The final dough should be lightly tacky but not sticky. Set the dough back in the bowl, and cover. Let sit for 15 minutes for the gluten in the dough to relax.",
				"2. While the dough rests prepare a large half sheet rimmed baking dish. Pour a generous amount of olive oil (~1 tbsp) and spread it to cover the bottom.",
				"3. Divide the rested dough into 16 equal pieces, ~55g each. Roll each piece of dough out to about 7\" long. If the dough resists being rolled out, leave to rest for a couple of minutes then roll again. To roll the dough, first roll back and forth under the palm of one of your hands until it's a few inches long. Then switch to using the first two to 3 fingers of each hand and roll the dough back and forth starting with your fingers spread with pointer fingers meeting at the center of the rope and moving them outwards to the end as you roll the dough under your fingers, never fully reaching the end of the dough to prevent a pointy torpedo tip. Place your fingers back in the center and continue rolling until the dough is rolled to your desired length.",
				"4. Set the rolled breadsticks in the prepared baking tray, with about 1/2\" between each breadstick. When all the breadsticks are shaped and placed in the baking tray cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 1 hour until the dough is puffy and starting to run into each other.",
				"5. While the dough is rising, heat the oven to 450 \u00baF with a rack placed in the center. Let the oven preheat for at least 45 minutes.",
				"6. When the breadsticks have risen and the oven is hot, remove the plastic from the pan and brush the tops of the breadsticks generously with olive oil (~ 2 tsp olive oil). Sprinkle on the granulated garlic as well as a little salt over each breadstick. Place in center rack of oven and bake for 8-10 minutes until just turning a light golden color in spots.",
				"7. Enjoy the breadsticks sprinkled with a little minced parsley (if using) alongside the easy marinara dipping sauce.",
				"8. While the breadsticks are rising, make the sauce. Add the tablespoon of olive oil to a small pot. Heat over medium-low heat and when warm add the minced garlic, crushed red pepper, dried thyme, and salt. Fry for 30-60 seconds, stirring, until the garlic is just a shade golden.",
				"9. Add the can of tomatoes and turn the heat up to medium. Bring to a low boil then turn the heat down to low. Let simmer gently and uncovered for about 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes.",
				"10. When done simmering, blend with an immersion blender or traditional blender for a smoother texture (optional). Taste the sauce and add salt if needed.",
				"11. Add a little fresh basil if using, and set aside until the breadsticks are ready to eat!"

Cover the bowl and leave the chiles to rehydrate for about 30 minutes. Put the soaked chiles in a blender along with 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar and enough water to help the chiles blend (about 1/4 cup, though add more if needed).

Add the chili paste (if you're sensitive to the taste of chili or spicy food, you can start with 1/2 of the paste you made, you can always add more later) as well as the tomato paste, cumin, and salt. Stir to combine, and let cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.",
				"5. Add the broth and the strained and rinsed hominy. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer. Taste the soup and decide if you want additional chili paste. Let the soup simmer for 15 minutes, then taste and add salt if desired.",
				"6. Serve the soup hot and topped with diced avocado, fresh cilantro, and lime wedges for freshly squeezed lime juice. Other possible garnishes include sliced radishes, microgreens, or corn chips."

The sage leaves will splutter a little when they hit the hot oil, so be careful. If you don't want to deal with making crispy sage, just chop up the fresh sage and add it alongside the garlic and crushed red pepper.",

Add red food coloring to half the dough and mix it in with the handheld or stand mixer to incorporate, adding more if necessary until you get your desired color and saturation.",
				"7. Place both mixing bowls in the freezer and let chill for 15 minutes so that the cookies are easier to shape.",

Transfer the twisted rope to the prepared baking tray and fold down the top third to create a hook. Repeat with the remaining dough to fill the baking tray, leaving ~1 1/2 inches between each cookie, as they won't spread much. I like to shape half of them hooking to the right and the other half to the left, but this is personal preference. Shape your second batch of cookies while the first are baking. At any point, if the dough is warming up and gets more challenging to shape, you can place it back in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to firm up again.",
				"9. Bake the tray of cookies on the center rack for 7-9 minutes, or until the bottom and edges take on the faintest shade of golden. Time can vary depending on your oven, so keep a close eye on them in the last few minutes of baking. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the baking tray, then gently transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Follow the same instructions for the second tray of cookies.",

You can also bake both trays of cookies at the same time with one oven rack set one place up from the middle and a second rack one spot lower. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through baking.",

				"1. First cook the potato in the microwave. Wash and dry the potato, then pierce it in several places with a fork to allow steam to escape while it cooks. Wrap the potato loosely in a paper towel, then microwave on high for about 4 minutes. Time can vary depending on your microwave and the size and shape of the potato. The potato is done when the insides are completely soft and no resistance is met when piercing with a fork. Let the potato cool until you can handle it, and then peel off the skin (it should easily rub off under your fingers, but you can use the edge of a spoon to assist). If using a potato ricer, you can skip the peeling step and cut the potato in half and place cut side down on the ricer, the ricer will separate the flesh from the peel and you can discard the peel after pressing. If you do not wish to use the microwave, you can bake the potato in the oven, but this will take a lot longer.",
				"2. While the potatoes cook make the pistou. In a small food processor, pulse the garlic to mince it. Then add the washed basil and salt and process to finely chop the basil. Add the olive oil and process to combine to your desired texture. Add the lemon juice and pulse to distribute. Taste and adjust the flavor if desired.",
				"3. At this point your potatoes should be done cooking. While they cool for a couple of minutes, pour 2 cartons of Fawen Broccoli & Sweet Potato Soup into a large pot. Cover and bring the soup to a low boil over medium-high heat.",
				"4. Meanwhile, make the dumpling dough. For the best results, send the cooked potato through a potato ricer into a large mixing bowl. Otherwise mash the potato with a potato masher or a fork until fairly smooth. This second method will leave small lumps of potato in your final dumpling, but that\u2019s ok, it will still be delicious. Sprinkle the flour, salt, and olive oil over the riced or mashed potato. Using your fingers crumble the potato and distribute throughout the mixture. The mixture will begin to form small crumbles. When you have an even looking pebbly mixture start squeezing handfuls of the dumpling dough in your hand as a way to knead the mixture into a cohesive mass. Continue until you form a smooth dough. If the dough feels dry, drizzle in additional olive oil. If the dough feels wet and at all sticky, sprinkle on more flour. Form the dough into 1 tsp sized dumplings. You should make around 16-18 dumplings.",
				"5. When the soup reaches a low boil, add the dumplings to the soup. Let cook for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally so they don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot. The dumplings will float to the top in about 4 minutes, and then let them cook about 1 additional minute before turning off the heat. Leave the pot covered to keep warm.",
				"6. While the dumplings are cooking, you can fry up the seitan bacon. Heat a large non-stick (such as cast iron) skillet over medium low heat. Add the oil when hot so that a thin film covers the entire pan. You can use less oil, for a less crispy result. Lay down a single layer of Sweet Earth Foods Benevolent Bacon and fry about 4 minutes, flipping every minute, or until the seitan bacon is a shade or two darker and the edges are a little black. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any extra oil, then chop or tear into small pieces.",
				"7. To serve, Divide soup between 2 bowls, spoon some pistou over the soup, and sprinkle on the torn seitan bacon. Add crushed red pepper or freshly ground black pepper as desired and enjoy your easy and delicious gourmet meal!"

			"ingredients": [
				"2 cups (250 g) all purpose flour -OR- 00 flour",
				"1/2 cup (120 g) reduced aquafaba (see notes)",
				"1 tsp (3 g) sea salt",
				"1 tbsp (15 g) extra virgin olive oil",
				"1 tsp (2 g) freshly ground black pepper"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 5 minutes",
			"serving": "~4 servings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Add flour, salt, and black pepper into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the oil and aquafaba and turn the food processor on and run until the mixture forms into a ball. In my food processor this takes around 90 seconds. Keep running another 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead for 1 minute to check the final texture of the dough. You want a firm, but still pliable dough that is not sticky or tacky to the touch.",
				"2. Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand: mix the flour, salt, and black pepper together. Add the oil and aquafaba and mix with a wooden spoon to form a shaggy, but rather dry mixture. Turn the mixture onto a clean counter and switch to your hands. Knead the dough until it forms a cohesive ball. If it is very dry then wet your hands and continue kneading. It will take 4-5 minutes to form a cohesive ball of dough. Let the dough rest, covered, for around 10 minutes to hydrate the flour, then knead a couple more minutes to check that it's the correct texture. The dough should be firm and not sticky or tacky, but still be pliable.",
				"3. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes. If resting more than 1 hour, place in fridge. The dough can be made up to 24 hours before rolling.",
				"4. When ready to roll the dough, divide into 3 or 4 portions (if this is your first time working with pasta dough separate into 4 portions, but as you get more confident 3 makes it go faster). Work with one piece of dough at a time, and keep the others wrapped tightly in plastic so they don't dry out.",
				"5. Roll the section of dough with a rolling pin until it's long and rectangular and around 1/4\" thin. Then take that strip of dough and feed it through a pasta roller at the thickest setting. Run it through that setting at least 3 times, until it runs through easily and is no longer pressing the dough. Then, turn the knob so that the pasta roller is one setting thinner. Repeat the process of running the dough through the roller around 3 times until it's not getting pressed. Set the roller one setting thinner and repeat once more.",
				"6. Take the dough and place it on the counter. Fold the sides of the dough into the center to meet. Then fold in half. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough in the opposite direction of the fold to create a neat rectangle. Then, repeat the process of running the dough through the thickest three settings of the pasta roller, starting with the thickest setting and running through a couple of times before turning to the thinner setting and so on. Run the dough with the thinner side going in first and rolling down the wider side, this is the opposite direction you were rolling the dough previously.",
				"7. Repeat the folding of the dough on the counter, and rolling perpendicular to the fold once more. Now feed the dough through the machine on the thickest setting once more, and work one setting at a time until you get to the 4th or 3rd from the thinnest setting. For linguini or fettuccini I prefer leaving my noodles a bit thicker and typically go for the 4th setting. For making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini I go to the 3rd or maybe even 2nd thinnest setting, as the edges get doubled up on.",
				"8. Lay the finished sheet of pasta on a parchment lined baking sheet and cover with a towel.",
				"9. Repeat this process with the remaining sections of dough. It should go fairy quickly once you have the hang of it.",
				"10. Once you have your sheets of dough, dust them with some flour and cut into the desired shapes. You can use a machine to cut into spaghetti or thicker noodles like linguini, or you can cut by hand to whatever width you desire. Toss the noodles in more flour if they are at all sticky. Cover until ready to cook. You can cook immediately or leave the noodles out to dry for an hour before cooking. You can flour the somewhat dried noodles well before transferring to a sealed container and putting in the fridge for a few hours or a day before cooking. If waiting longer than a day, place in the freezer.",
				"11. To cook the noodles, bring a pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the noodles to the pot and cook for 1-2 minutes. Depending on the size of the noodles you may need less time, such as if you make spaghetti. Begin checking for doneness after 30 seconds. Be careful, the noodles can go from done to over cooked quickly. For my linguini style of noodles 90 seconds seems to work perfectly.",
				"12. Drain the noodles and toss in your favorite pasta sauce, or with some olive oil and vegan parmesan cheese. Taste before adding salt, as the noodles might not need any more. Enjoy!"

				"1. Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water in a large liquid measuring cup or mixing bowl. Stir and let sit for a few minutes to get foamy. Add the oil.",
				"2. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and mix together with a wooden spoon or by hand (wetting your hand to prevent sticking), until you have a coarse dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and knead by hand around 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add flour if necessary, though give it a minute before adding as it takes time for the flour to absorb the moisture. You should have a soft and lightly tacky dough (not sticky). Alternatively you can knead in a stand mixer on low speed for 4-5 minutes.",
				"3. Transfer the dough ball to a lightly oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 45 minutes - 1 hour until doubled in size. [If working in advance you can let it rise in the fridge overnight--put it in the fridge immediately after kneading in a tightly covered large mixing bowl, and then let it come to room temperature for about 20 minutes before dividing and shaping the next day.]",
				"4. Heat the oil over medium-low heat in a small 9\" cast iron or non-stick skillet. Add the white and light green parts of the scallions, the garlic, and ginger and fry for 2-4 minutes until soft. You don't want much, if any, browning.",
				"5. Add the seitan and cook 3-5 minutes until seitan is heated through and golden in spots. Add the curry powder, cayenne (if using), turmeric, and a pinch of salt and stir to coat, cooking about 30 seconds.",
				"6. Add the coconut milk and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce has thickened, around 3-5 minutes. Turn off heat and squeeze in lime juice. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired. Set curry seitan aside until ready to use. Filling can be made a day in advance.",
				"7. Punch down the dough and divide into 12 (~54 g) balls of dough. Let rest a few minutes before shaping so the gluten has a chance to relax.",
				"8. Prepare your steaming apparatus, fill with water and bring to a boil. Line the steamer with parchment to prevent sticking and/or cut 12 ~2.5\" squares of parchment paper to use with each bun.",
				"9. Pat or roll out each piece of dough into a ~5\" round. Place in your non-dominant hand, and add about 2 tablespoons of curry seitan to the center. Take the edges of the dough and pinch over the filling with your thumb and forefinger, then rotate 90\u00ba and pinch the dough together again. Continue pinching the edges of the dough together until the filling is completely covered and there are no gapping holes in the dough. Give a little twist to where the dough is gathered to seal it off. Place the prepared bun on a piece of parchment. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
				"10. When the water is boiling place the buns in batches in the steamer basket. Be careful not to overcrowd as they double in size while steaming. In my steamer I can make 4 at a time.",
				"11. Steam each batch 12-15 minutes. Best enjoyed warm or on the same day. Store leftovers in a tightly sealed container in the fridge and reheat in the microwave until warm. Cover with a damp paper towel while microwaving if they feel dry."

				"2. In a large mixing bowl add the flour, sugar, and salt. Whisk to combine. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and stir to combine with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough is formed.",
				"3. Turn the dough out onto a clean and floured counter. Knead for ~2 minutes, adding more flour as necessary to create a lightly tacky (but not sticky) dough. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to give the flour a chance to hydrate and the gluten to relax, then knead an additional 3 minutes until you have a relatively smooth and very lightly tacky ball of dough. Place the dough into a large, oiled mixing bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until about double in size. *During this time, you can prepare the custard.",
				"4. Once the dough has doubled in size, gently deflate and turn it out onto a clean and floured counter. Gently roll the dough out until it is 1/2\" thick, and using a 2 1/2\" - 3\" round cutter, cut into rounds, pressing down firmly but not twisting the cutter. Knead the scraps of dough together gently to reform a cohesive dough, then roll again to cut, repeating as necessary to shape all the dough. Place the cut rounds onto a lightly floured baking tray and sprinkle some flour over the tops. Lightly cover with some plastic wrap or a towel and set aside to proof an additional 20 minutes.",
				"5. While the dough is rising for the second time, heat up your oil and/or shortening to deep fry. In a large heavy bottomed pot, pour enough oil to cover at least 2\" of the pot. Heat it to 350 \u00baF - 365 \u00baF. Do not let the oil go above 375 \u00baF to cook, or you will end up with raw dough in the center of your doughnuts. Prepare your doughnut cooling station by placing a wire cooling rack over a paper towel lined baking tray.",

Fry about 1 minute then flip and fry an additional 1 minute, until they are a dark golden brown on each side. Using a slotted or wire spoon, drain each doughnut from the oil and place on the prepared wire rack. When cool enough to handle, roll each side on a plate covered in powdered sugar. Return to the rack.",

Top with your desired toppings while they're still hot and wet for optimal sticking. If using seeds, gently press them into the dough after topping. Repeat with remaining bagels.",
				"9. When the oven is pre-heated and bagels are all boiled and toppings added, place the baking sheet into the oven on the center rack and turn the heat down to 450 \u00baF. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet and bake an additional 8-10 minutes until the bagels are a dark golden brown. If you didn't use barley malt syrup in the poaching liquid, they will not brown as darkly or richly.",

Once cool, peel off the blacked skin, cut the tops off and deseed, then roughly chop.",
				"3. Turn your oven to 350 \u00baF.",
				"4. Place your black beans, onion, garlic, and beets onto a parchment lined, large, rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle the oil over top along with the ancho chili, cumin, and teaspoon of salt. Toss to coat and spread into a single layer (some overlap ok). Bake for 30 minutes, stirring once halfway through.",
				"5. When cooked the beets and onion will be soft, and the black beans will have dried out slightly, splitting their skins. Set aside to cool.",
				"6. Once cool enough to handle, reserve ~1/2 cup of the black beans (don't stress if you grab a few beets along with them).",
				"7. In a food processor combine the cooked rice, the roasted beans and beet mixture (except reserved portion), chopped roasted pepper, and mayo. Pulse the mixture to combine until it begins to will clump. Test by trying to form a patty, it should hold together easily and be quite moist and probably a bit sticky. There should still be some texture left in the mixture, but you won't see large chunks of anything. At this point, taste for salt and seasoning and adjust if necessary. Then, add the bread crumbs and the reserved black bean mixture. Pulse just until equally distributed but barely chopped up.",
				"8. Let the mixture hydrate the bread crumbs for at least 30 minutes before using.",
				"9. Once the breadcrumbs have hydrated (they will have turned pink from the beets), form your patties. Use a 1/3 cup measure and form 3 - 3 1/2\" diameter burgers. Use a cookie cutter or ring mold if you have one for clean edges. If forming the patties in advance, keep them separated with parchment or wax paper when stacking.",
				"10. To cook the burgers, heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-low heat. Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, adding vegan cheese on the second side if desired (cover the pan to steam and melt).",
				"11. Serve with hamburger buns, and possible toppings include (but are not limited to): grilled or caramelized onions, avocado, sliced fresh or jarred jalape\u00f1o, vegan mayo, and hot sauce. Enjoy!"

			"recipe": [
				"1. In a large mixing bowl add lukewarm water and yeast. Stir, then let hydrate for 1 minute. Add the oil, then flour, salt, and sugar. Mix by hand or with a wooden spoon until just combined into a shaggy dough, around 30 seconds.",
				"2. To knead with a stand mixer: Using the dough hook, turn mixer to lowest speed and let knead for 3 minutes. Turn off mixer and let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Then turn back on low and let knead an additional 3 minutes. Turn the dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute adding flour or water if necessary. The dough should be lightly tacky but not sticky, if too sticky add more flour and if not at all tacky wet your hands and knead the water into the dough.",
				"3. To knead by hand: Knead dough by hand for three minutes, beginning in the bowl until it forms a nice uniform mass, then transferring to a clean, lightly floured surface. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 3-4 minutes. In the last minute of kneading add water or flour as necessary to create a lightly tacky but not sticky dough.",
				"4. Place dough into a lightly oiled large mixing bowl and turn the dough ball, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 4 days. If you are going to bake in batches, divide before refrigerating and place each batch into a separate bowl.",
				"5. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (~108g each), there is no need to flour the counter as it should not stick. Working gently to deflate as little as possible, form the dough into balls by forming a rough round shape. On a clean surface, with the seam side facing down, cup your hand over the ball of dough and make a small circular motion. This will pull the outside of the dough around and under and create a tight skin around the dough ball. There will be a seam at the bottom of the ball, if your dough is a bit dry the seam will not close (don't worry about it, just keep going with the process--it will turn out fine!), but if it's at the correct hydration the seam will mostly close up.",
				"6. Place the formed balls of dough onto a lightly greased parchment lined baking sheet, seam side down. Spray the tops with oil and lightly cover with plastic wrap. Leave to rise for 1 - 1 1/2 hours until about doubled in size. To check that they are fully proofed and ready for their baking soda bath and baking, poke the dough with your finger to create an indentation (poke the side or bottom to not mar the top of your bun!). If fully proofed, it will only spring back ~25%. If it springs back almost all the way quickly the dough needs more time, and if it doesn't spring back at all you've over proofed and work as quickly as possible to get the dough in the oven. Pop the baking sheet into the fridge if you need to.",
				"7. About 45 minutes before the dough is ready to bake, preheat your oven to 400 \u00baF and place a rack in the center of the oven.",
				"8. When the buns are fully proofed, prepare the baking soda bath. Add the 2 quarts of water into a large stock pot and bring to a boil. When boiling add the baking soda and salt. Working with 3-4 buns at a time (don't over crowd the pot!), boil 30-60 seconds on each side. Remove with a slotted spoon and return to baking sheet. Repeat until all buns are boiled. If you would like to score the tops of the buns use a sharp knife and cut an X pattern into the top. This is optional.",
				"9. For a little extra shine, brush the tops of the buns with a little non-dairy milk right before baking.",
				"10. Bake the buns for 12 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet for even baking, and bake an additional 8-10 minutes. The buns are done when they are a deep golden color. Let cool at least 20 minutes before using.",
				"11. If you don't finish them on the first day, slice open the buns then pop them into a freezer bag. Freeze until ready to use, just allow to defrost for ~30+ minutes on the counter then toast or grill."

				"1. Cook the eggplant: Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF. Prick the eggplant all over with a knife so that steam can vent. Roast the eggplant for ~1 hour, rotating about every 20 minutes, until the eggplant is soft and no resistance is met when pricked with a knife. Set aside to cool, cutting in half will speed the process.",
				"2. While the eggplant is roasting, cook the barley. Combine the barley and 1/2 tsp of salt in a pot and cover with plenty of water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes until the barley is chewy but cooked through. When done, drain and set aside.",
				"3. Warm a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and shallots, and cook until softened and golden, ~3-5 minutes. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt and lower heat to medium-low. Cook until golden and caramelized, ~6-9 minutes. Add the thyme and oregano and cook for 1 minute. Then deglaze the plan by adding the red wine vinegar to loosen the caramelized bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Immediately transfer to a food processor.",
				"4. Add the chickpeas (reserving ~1/2 cup of them), 1/2 cup of the roasted eggplant (use the rest for another purpose), the cooked barley, chopped sun dried tomato, garlic, and 1 tsp of salt to the food processor and pulse to combine. When the mixture is mashed and clumping together, taste and adjust seasoning if desired. Then add the remaining 1/2 cup of chickpeas and the vital wheat gluten and pulse to combine. Due to the gluten, the mixture will probably form one large clump.",
				"5. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00baF to precook the burgers.",

Pat into a 3 - 3 1/2\" round (use a ring mold or cookie cutter for a clean edge). Don't stress if cheese pokes through the sides.",
				"7. Place assembled burgers onto a parchment lined, oiled baking sheet and bake at 375 \u00baF for 10-12 minutes on each side. At this point you can eat them, but they're even better the next day, grilling or frying on a skillet to warm and brown!",
				"8. Combine tomatoes, shallots, and garlic into a small bowl. Add the olive oil, red wine vinegar, 1/4 tsp of salt, and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and gently stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if desired. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours before using.",
				"9. Serve the burgers with the marinated tomatoes and your choice of burger toppings, such as: avocado, mayo, vegan cheese, lettuce, or caramelized onion. Enjoy!"

				"2. Prep the jalape\u00f1os: cut off the tops and cut around the white pith with a pairing knife. Then go in with a butter knife and scrape out as much of the seeds and membrane as you can. I found it easy to just stick the knife in (and don't use a sharp knife for this--you don't want any accidents!), and twist it around, which breaks off the white membrane and loosens the seeds, which can then be tapped or shaken out of the pepper, leaving a hollow jalape\u00f1o behind.",
				"3. Fill a piping bag, or a ziplock bag, with almond cheese and snip off the end. Pipe the cheese into the peppers.",
				"4. Set up three bowls as your dipping stations. In the first bowl mix together the ground flax and water and let sit for around 10 minutes to thicken. Alternatively you can microwave it in 30 second intervals a couple of times to speed the process. In the second bowl mix together the flour mixture, and mix together the bread crumb mixture in the third bowl.",
				"5. To dip: Take each stuffed jalape\u00f1o and dip first into the flax egg, and then into the flour mixture. Put it back into the flax mixture, and then toss in the bread crumbs. Then set on the greased baking tray. Continue with the remaining jalape\u00f1os. *If your flax mixture starts to thicken too much, add a little more water. To make the process easier, have 2 forks to help you move the jalape\u00f1os between stations, a fork for the dry flour and bread crumb mixture and a second one for the sticky flax mixture.",
				"6. Once all the jalape\u00f1os are breaded, spray them with oil, or drizzle some on top. Then bake them at 425 \u00baF for 25-30 minutes, flipping them over in the last 5-10 minutes for more even browning.",

			"ingredients": [
				"375g (2 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) all purpose flour",
				"125g (3/4 cup + 3 tbsp) whole wheat flour",
				"400g (1 3/4 cup) water, lukewarm, 90-95 \u00baF",
				"12g (2 tsp) fine sea salt",
				"2.0g (1/2 tsp) instant yeast",
				"95g (1 cup) walnut halves"
			],
			"time": "15 hours 50 minutes",
			"serving": "1 loaf",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF.",
				"2. When the oven is hot, roast the walnuts for 15-20 minutes in a small baking sheet, stirring halfway through, until the walnuts are lightly browned and smell toasty. Set aside to cool.",
				"3. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the all purpose flour and whole wheat flour. Add the water and mix together with a wooden spoon or by hand until shaggy. Cover and let sit for 20 minutes.",
				"4. Sprinkle the salt and yeast over the top of the dough. Using wet hands, incorporate the salt and yeast by reaching under the edges of the dough and gently pulling it up and away from the sides of the bowl, then folding the dough to rest on top of salt mixture. Give the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat, until you've pulled and folded the dough over all the salt and yeast to cover. Next, pinch the dough into several segments between your first finger and thumb. Then repeat the folding process to bring the dough back together to one piece. Repeat this segmenting and folding a couple more times until the salt is well distributed. Rewet your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. All in all, this process will only take 1-2 minutes. Leave the dough to rest for around 10 minutes, covered.",
				"5. After ~10 minutes, sprinkle the toasted walnuts overtop, and incorporate with wet hands using the same method you used to add the salt and yeast. When the walnuts are well distributed with the final folding of the dough, turn the dough ball so the seam is face down in the bowl. Leave to rest for 20 minutes, covered.",
				"6. {You will be leaving the dough to rise for a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours at room temperature. During this time you will apply 3 folds to the dough every 30 minutes for the first 1 1/2 hours, and then leave it to rise untouched an additional 30-60 minutes.}",
				"7. After incorporating the walnuts and letting the dough rest for 20 minutes you will apply the first fold. Using wet hands and the same process you did to fold dough over the salt and nuts, you will reach your hands under a section of the dough, lift gently so not to tear the dough, and place it over top the rest of the dough. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat around 4 times until you have a nice ball in the bowl. Rotate the ball so the seam is touching the bowl. Let rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the folding. Rest another 30 minutes and fold for the last time. Leaving the seam down, let the dough rise at room temperature at least another 30 minutes (no longer if your kitchen is much warmer than 70 \u00baF).",
				"8. Move the dough to the fridge and leave overnight, or no longer than 36 hours.",
				"9. One hour before you are ready to bake the bread, preheat the oven to 475 \u00baF with your high heat safe dutch oven inside.",
				"10. While the oven is preheating, shape your bread.",
				"11. First prepare either a proofing basket or a large mixing bowl. If using a proofing basket, simply generously flour the basket and use your hands to distribute the flour around the bowl. If using a large mixing bowl, line it with a lint free towel, and then generously sprinkle flour onto the towel.",
				"12. Lightly flour a clean work surface, and gently ease the dough (so not to allow the gases formed to escape) onto the counter. Gently ease the dough into a large rough circle (the shape isn't important), being careful not to tear the dough. To shape the dough, you will begin with the same folding technique (this time with dry or lightly floured hands). Take a section of the dough and gently stretch it up until you feel resistance, then fold over the middle. Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball.",
				"13. Take the ball of dough and move over to an unfloured section of the counter. With the dough sitting on the counter seam side down, cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Then place the ball of dough into the prepared proofing basket or mixing bowl seam side down. Dust a little extra flour over top, then cover with a towel and leave to rise for ~60 minutes (If your kitchen is very warm you may only leave it for 45 minutes).",
				"14. To check the dough is ready for the oven, dip your finger first in a little flour, then poke the dough about 3/4\". If the indentation springs up slightly but then stops, leaving a smaller indentation, the dough is ready to bake. If it springs up almost 100% right away then it needs more time. If the dough doesn't spring back at all, it is overproofed, but that's ok, still bake it, just get it to the oven as quickly as possible.",
				"15. When the dough passes the indentation test, it's time to bake. Using oven mitts, carefully remove the dutch oven and take the lid off. Turn the proofing basket upside down on to a floured surface and tap the basket to release the dough. You should see some cracks on the top of the dough (where the seams were), this is where the dough will expand and crack and where the height of the loaf comes from.",
				"16. Using two hands, carefully lift the dough and drop it into the dutch oven (be careful of burning yourself!). Cover the pot and place it into the oven. Bake for 30 minutes covered. After 30 minutes, carefully remove the lid, turn the heat down to 450 \u00baF and bake an additional 20 minutes. You can bake longer for a darker crust, or slightly less time for a lighter crust.",
				"17. When you have reached your desired crust, remove the pot from the oven and turn the bread out. Place it on a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 20-30 minutes before slicing into. It finishes baking outside of the oven in these last minutes.",
				"18. Enjoy your bread!",
				"19. To store, place cut side down on a cutting board, never place it in fridge, and do not put in a plastic bag. If it is going to take you more than 3 days to eat the bread, slice it and transfer it to a freezer bag, with pieces of parchment or wax paper between the slices. Keep frozen and toast as needed."

				"1. In a wide and and ideally shallow pot whisk together the coconut milk, sugar, and the pinch of salt. Bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat, then turn the heat down to an active simmer. Let simmer for 25-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until you are left with 1 cup of condensed coconut milk. How long it takes will depend on how high your heat is and how wide/shallow your pot is. Check with a measuring cup as you go until you have the correct volume. Set aside to cool to room temperature. This results in a viscous but pourable light caramel brown cream.",
				"2. *Note: if you make the condensed coconut milk the day before and refrigerate, you might need to bring it back closer to room temperature and thin with water to achieve a pourable consistency.",
				"3. First, preheat your oven to 350 \u00baF.",
				"4. In a stand mixer or with a handheld electric beater, lightly beat together the aquafaba and cream of tartar until frothy. Then turn up the speed until high and beat until you have stiff peaks. This takes 10 minutes with my stand mixer but could take longer on yours, and will take more time with a handheld electric mixer. You cannot over whip aquafaba, and if you do this too far in advance and it starts to deflate you can rewhip it back up to stiff peaks at any time.",
				"5. Prepare 2 parchment lined baking sheets, and make sure the oven is preheated to 350 \u00baF before beginning.",
				"6. In a large bowl, mix together the shredded coconut, almond flour, salt, and extracts you are using with a wooden spoon or a silicon spatula. Then stir in the condensed milk until it coats everything. At this point if you squeeze some of the mixture it will stick together but otherwise it does not tend to hold together.",
				"7. Take a large scoop of the whipped aquafaba (about 1/4-1/3 of the mixture), and using a silicon spatula, gently fold the aquafaba to incorporate it evenly in the coconut mixture. This step will help ensure more of the air stays trapped in the whip.",
				"8. Once mixed evenly add the remainder of the whipped aquafaba and gently fold that in.",
				"9. On a parchment lined baking sheet scoop 1 1/2\" (walnut sized) balls. You can either form them with your hands, or using a cookie scoop. Leave the balls rougher around the edges for more a uneven golden effect, or smooth them in your hands for a more evenly browned look. Place them on the baking sheets about 2\" apart.",

				"11. Leave to cool completely, they will continue to firm as they cool. If you are dipping in chocolate, chilling the cooled cookies in the fridge will help make them a bit sturdier.",
				"12. Take each cookie and set it in the melted chocolate, and using a spoon or spatula, help lift it out from underneath the cookie so it doesn't get stuck in the chocolate. Alternatively, you can spoon some chocolate onto the bottom of each cookie.",
				"13. Place chocolate dipped cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet, and set in the fridge until chocolate is set, 30-60 minutes.",

				"1. Stir the dry ingredients together.",
				"2. Add the warm water and oil, and mix to combine. Turn onto a clean work surface and knead for a few minutes. The dough should be soft and moist.",
				"3. Set aside for about 15 minutes to fully hydrate the dough before using.",
				"4. Divide the dough into six equal pieces, and roll each into a ball. Keep the dough covered while not in use.",
				"5. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat.",
				"6. To shape the pupusas, it is easiest if you dampen your hands. Take a ball in your hands, flatten it between your palms making a disk. Put in a scant tablespoon of refried beans and about a half tablespoon worth of cheese right into the center.",
				"7. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling, then working gently, press the dough into a fat disk around the filling. Keep pressing the dough gently while rotating, to work it into a thinner disk. Don't panic if the dough starts to split. Small holes in the dough are not a big deal, but if you get a large one, just pull a little extra dough (either from the remaining balls, or from an edge of the pupusa you are forming that has a little to spare) over the hole and using a wet finger, smear it closed.",
				"8. Once you have a nice sized pupusa (~6 inches), oil the pre-heated skillet (spray oil works nicely here, but for more restaurant style pour a little oil onto the pan). Cook the pupusa about 2 minutes on each side, or until it has some golden and browning spots and the dough looks fully cooked.",
				"9. Continue shaping and cooking the pupusas. Serve warm.If you want to shape all pupusas before cooking, try placing them on a piece of parchment paper so that they don't stick when you pick them up.",
				"10. Combine everything into a large mixing bowl. Massage the cabbage a little with your hands to help soften it a little. Set in the fridge until ready to eat.",
				"11. Serve the pupusas with some slaw, salsa, guacamole, and/or sour cream. Enjoy!"
