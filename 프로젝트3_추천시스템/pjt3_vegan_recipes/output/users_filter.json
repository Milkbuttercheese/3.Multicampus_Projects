To make tortillas mix flour, baking powder and salt in a big bowl. Add olive oil to the flour mixture and incorporate it well with your hands. Once water is ready, add it in. Initially mix it all together with a spoon as the mixture will be too hot, then start kneading it (in the bowl) with your hand. Knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Rest the dough for about 30-45 mins covered with a wet kitchen towel. The resting step is very important so do not skip it.\",\"5. To make re-fried black beans, mash cooked beans using a potato masher (or a food processor). I like mine with some whole beans left in, but the consistency is up to you. Heat up olive oil in a pan.

Simmer gently until most moisture has cooked out and the mixture has thickened \u2013 you can have it looser (add more water) or thicker \u2013 again consistency is up to you.

Now, it\u2019s time to finish the tortillas. Set a large pan on a medium heat (it\u2019s important not to get the pan too hot, if your tortilla is getting dark brown spots very quickly it means that the pan is too hot). Set another pan on the lowest heat and dampen a kitchen towel \u2013 this set-up is needed to keep tortillas warm and supple. Start rolling out tortillas on a lightly floured surface. Refrain from adding too much flour as it will produce dry tortillas. Once you are happy with the shape (they should be round*) and thickness (I roll mine quite thin), put your tortilla on a pan. Little bubbles should start to appear after about one minute. Do not wait until the bubbles go dark brown as that will make tortillas dry out too much and they\u2019ll crack later. After about 2 minutes (depends on how thick yours are) from when tortilla hit the pan, flip the tortilla and cook for only about 30 seconds on the other side. As soon as you are done, put the tortilla into the other pan and cover with damp kitchen towel. Continue the same way with all your tortillas.\",\"9. Finally, assemble your tortillas by putting chopped up lettuce, re-fried beans, salsa, rice and guacamole in the middle of the tortilla and rolling it up.\"]","recipe_id":2445,"serving":"serves 4","time":"20 min","title":"Vegan burrito with vegan tortilla filling","total_fat":"24 g"},"518":{"calories":"311 kcal","carbs":"42 g","category":"1.India+South America+South Asia <Main ingredients: cumin\/coriander\/cilantro\/lime\/avocado\/onion>","image":"https:\/\/cdn77-s3.lazycatkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/baked-beans-straight-from-oven-800x585.jpg","ingredients":"[200 g dry medium white beans, soaked overnight, 3 tbsp olive oil, 3\u00a0large\u00a0tomatoes, peeled and diced (or 1 and \u00bd 400 g tin), 1 tbsp tomato paste, 1 small red onion, finely diced, 2 cloves garlic, finely diced, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 heaped tsp ground cinnamon, 2 tsp brown sugar, \u00bd tsp chilli flakes (optional), 1 generous tsp fine sea salt, few grinds of black pepper, handful of parsley, finely chopped]","link":"https:\/\/www.lazycatkitchen.com\/greek-baked-beans\/","pk":2449,"protein":"13 g","recipe":"[\"1.

Our preferred way of mashing is with an immersion blender. If using an immersion blender, tip the pot to one side so the blade can be submerged and blend until the beans are creamy and smooth.

Then peel away the skin, transfer to a mixing bowl or shallow plate, and mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. Set aside.\",\"8. To the soaked masa mixture add salt, baking powder, and avocado oil and stir. Then add broth (warm or room temperature for best results) a little at a time until a thick paste is achieved. It shouldn't be liquidy or crumbly (see photo). Be sure to stir well so it's fully combined. Set aside.\",\"9. Remove corn husks from water and pat dry (when water remains on the husks, the masa can have a hard time adhering). Then take one husk in your non-dominant hand (or place on a flat, clean surface) with the wider\/broader edge facing toward you (narrow end away from you).\",\"10. Add 2 \u2013 2 \u00bd Tbsp masa, then use the back of a spoon to spread the mixture from the bottom 1\/3 center of the husk to the right edge (see photo). Spread into a thin layer \u2014 somewhere between 1\/8th-inch and 1\/4-inch thick (not too thin or the fillings spill through, not too thick or the tamale takes longer to cook).\",\"11. Then add ~1 \u00bd Tbsp of the mashed sweet potatoes to the center of the masa and top with ~1 Tbsp of beans (see photo). Tuck the right side of the corn husk over the bean filling, right where the masa's left edge is. Then continue rolling until the seams meet. Then fold the narrow edge of corn husk over the seam and set in a loaf pan or dish that will keep your tamales upright. Continue until you have used all your masa mixture and filling (as original recipe is written, ~24 tamales).\",\"12. To a large pot or Dutch oven, add a steamer basket. Fill pot with water until it almost touches the base of the steamer basket. Then add the tamales, keeping them upright if possible (see photo).\",\"13. Turn heat to high, then, once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer to steam the tamales for about 1 hour. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re done when the masa appears cooked. If you aren\u2019t sure, you can remove one tamale, let it cool for a few minutes (as they stiffen up the more they cool), unwrap, and test. If they\u2019re cooked through, they\u2019re ready to enjoy. If not, steam for 5-10 minutes more, or longer as needed.\",\"14. Once cooked, remove the lid and let steam escape for a few minutes. Then they're ready to enjoy! Top with desired garnishes. We loved hot sauce, cilantro, lime juice, and a little dairy-free yogurt (Culina plain is our favorite, though vegan sour cream would be delicious, too).\",\"15. Store cooled tamales covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Reheat in the microwave or in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop until hot.\",\"16. To freeze, let tamales cool, then add to a parchment-lined baking sheet and arrange in a single layer.

It should hold together. It can stick to your hands a little, but if it is very sticky or too wet and falling apart, you can add a bit more corn starch. This can vary depending on what brand and variety of tofu you use, but the recipe is quite flexible. Mix in the frozen peas. Shape the kofta mixture into heaping 1 tablespoon portions and roll into balls or into a football shape (a torpedo).\",\"6. To fry the kofta: Heat about 2-inches of high heat safe oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Test the oil either with a thermometer until it is 325-350 \u00baF or you can test with a small piece of the kofta mixture: the oil should bubble\/boil vigorously around it and the kofta should float to the surface fairly quickly after being dropped in. When the oil is heated fry the shaped kofta in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, until the kofta is a beautiful dark golden brown color, flipping halfway through for even cooking. This should take 5-10 minutes, depending on the temperature of your oil, how much oil you have heated (more oil means the temperature is more stable when you add the kofta), and how many kofta you add at once. When the kofta are cooked, transfer to a paper towel lined plate with a wire spider strainer. Repeat with remaining batched of kofta until all are cooked.\",\"7. To bake the kofta: Preheat the oven to 425 \u00baF. Line a baking tray with parchement and spray or brush with oil. Arrange the shaped kofta onto the baking tray so there is 1\/2-1\\\" between each kofta. Spray or brush the tops with oil. Bake for 30-40 minutes, flipping after the first 15-20 minutes, until both sides are golden and the edges of the kofta are crispy and chewy. It's normal for the kofta to lose their shape a little and flatten when baked.\",\"8. When ready to serve, pour the sauce overtop the kofta (only use what you will eat in one sitting, as the kofta get soggy once in the sauce), then pour the reserved coconut milk over top the kofta.
