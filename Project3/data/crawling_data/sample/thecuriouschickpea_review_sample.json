				"Terrific recipe! I wish I&#8217;d had a chance to take a photo before it vanished. Not only tasty but stunning enough to serve guests&#8230;when we can invite them over again. Plus it&#8217;s easy to prepare, even with homemade gnocchi &#8212; the biggest challenge was remembering to bake the potatoes ahead of time.",
				"HI, can Xanthyum Gum be used instead of tapioca starch?",
				"Oooh this is like all my favorite things in one *drooool* Can you make this in one large casserole dish rather than the individual ramekins? If so how big should it be?",
				"I often use sunflower seeds in place of cashews, it gives a very similar result!",
				"Hello! I love this and have shared with a friend. She is allergic to c.oil. What would you sub for in the mozzarella sauce? Thank you!",
				"Just made this and my kids and loved it. Thankyou! Just wondering, do you think the cheese is freezable? I have HEAPS leftover",
				"Just made this the other day and it&#8217;s really good! I used jarred sauce so I can&#8217;t speak to the sauce recipe. Funny, I was a little worried I&#8217;d done the mozzarella wrong because it was liquid, and I thought it would just mix into the gnocchi and make a mess, but it worked perfectly! I could taste the coconut oil a little bit, but I didn&#8217;t use refined coconut oil which I think would make all the difference in the world. Thanks for this recipe!",
				"I&#8217;m going to give this a shot. It looks fantastic!\nHowever, I&#8217;m wondering if there is an alternative to the cashews for the mozz sauce? I am deathly allergic to all nuts&#8230;and I have yet to find a vegan cheese that actually is stretchy AND tastes good. Being new to eating this way, and being a huge cheese lover previously, it is the one thing I miss from &#8220;the Before&#8221;.",

				"When I made this naan, I found out I was completely out of salt! I tried subbing 2 tsp of very salty mushroom powder and wound up with such a delicious umami flavor. I couldn&#8217;t get enough! Figured I&#8217;d note that here in case anyone else wants to try adding mushroom powder to their naan as well.",
				"This naan was excellent! Everyone loved it. It was so soft and tender. I really like that you use weight for baking, it makes me more confident your recipes are going to work. Thanks so much for sharing!",
				"Can this Naan recipe be made with gluten free flour?",
				"I have a question! We have a pizza stone and a barbecue, and sometimes make Italian pizza in the barbecue (it&#8217;s made by high heat and the pizza cooks in a couple of minutes &#8211; it&#8217;s how they do it there). Can I use the barbecue in the same way to cook the naan? Thank you!",
				"Obviously submitted before reading.  That should be *lakanto",
				"I omitted the oil and used lake to monkfruit sweetener in place of the sugar. It still turned out amazing. Thank",
				"Do you flip it while baking?",
				"Hi, thank you for the recipe. This Naan was so easy to make &amp; so delicious, airy &amp; flavourful. I made my dough yesterday, using coconut plain yogurt, as it was the only vegan yogurt in my supermarket (very small rural town). I put it into the fridge overnight  &amp; rolled it out &amp; cooked it tonight on a pizza stone.\nI doubled the recipe because I am taking them to work tomorrow (I am catering a work luncheon for 13 people). I made some large &amp; some small (the small ones are perfect for scooping up the red lentil curry &amp; the sweet potato, chickpea &amp; spinach Dahl I\u2019ve made as well) I can\u2019t wait to get feed back from my work colleagues.\nCheers from Australia",
				"This turned out great! I didn&#8217;t have enough yogurt to do 1 full cup so I inverted the measurements for water and yogurt (1/2 cup instead) and it worked out perfectly. So pillowy! I let it rise/ferment in the fridge overnight. I also pan-fried them on a cast iron rather than heating up my oven.",
				"Well, since I was completely blind to the fact that you included measurements by weight, it seems clear that it&#8217;s me who made some kind of big mistake! I guess I&#8217;m just jealous that everyone else seemed to have made it with such wonderful results \ud83d\ude41\nThe bread turned out, but it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;flatbread&#8221; than naan. I&#8217;ll try again &#8211; thanks for the great recipes!!",
				"Yes, I measured and used white flour. I measured by volume, as there was no weight indicated in the recipe. I did whisk the dry ingredients together as per the recipe. The yogurt was not thick/greek yogurt &#8211; I easily poured it into my measuring cup. The only thing I can imagine is that I zoned out while adding the flour and added an extra cup &#8211; it&#8217;s the only thing that makes sense, regardless of how nonsensical it sounds \ud83d\ude42\nI&#8217;ll be baking the bread shortly, and I&#8217;m sure it will work out well with the extra water I added.\nThanks for getting back to me.",
				"I&#8217;ve just prepared this dough as per this recipe, adding the 1 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup warm water and 3 T melted butter. It is SO dry! I can&#8217;t believe that you achieved the sticky, moist dough in your pictures and in your directions with only this amount of liquids. Is it possible you&#8217;ve made a mistake? I had to add at least another 1/2 cup of water just to get this dough anywhere near the pictures and your description. Please clarify &#8211; thanks!",
				"Hey! My naan tasted great but I think I still must have done something wrong. I don&#8217;t have a stone so I used the baking sheet with parchment paper method, the oven was at 500 degrees (the highest mine will go) and it melted the wax paper and stuck to the naan. Also the naan burned at its thinest most stretched out parts &#8211; so maybe I wouldn&#8217;t stretch it so thin next time? I don&#8217;t know. I had better luck making a non-vegan naan recipe, but I would really like to make this recipe right. To start, I think I&#8217;ll try not using any parchment paper next time.",
				"Dear Eva,\nFirst time trying to make naan and I\u2019m so lucky to chanced ipon your recipe. It worked beautifully! I don\u2019t have an oven so I pan fry it and the result is crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside! Its so Super delicious! I\u2019ll definitely make it again and again! Even thinking of using it as a pizza base (but pan fried style) ? Thank you, Eva!\nCheers!\nLynda",
				"For some reason the dough didn\u2019t rise, I followed the instructions properly. Any chance the yeast is supposed to be out in water and added to wet ingredients instead?",
				"Hello Eva,\nCan this Naan be made with any gluten free flour? Chickpea flour? \nBest regards,\nPaige",
				"I&#8217;m about to try this with sweetened almond milk yogurt&#8230;.only because it&#8217;s all i have and I think a critical part of richner naan. I am noticing sugar is added in recipe anyway, albeit possibly less than what&#8217;s in the yogurt I have&#8230;.I hope this doesn&#8217;t result in a sweet naan!",
				"This is an amazing naan recipe, thank you! Non-vegan husband who loves restaurant naan absolutely loved this, and so did I!",
				"This is a flawless recipe! Delicious to the core! Thank you so much!",
				"Correction: What yogurt did you use in your naan?",
				"Hello,\nI would love to make your naan.  However, I went from vegetarian to vegan and omitted all dairy.  Do have a replacement for yogurt?",
				"This naan looks amazing, Eva &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to try my hand at making it! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Your recipes and photos are just beautiful!",
				"Holy deliciousness, Eva!  This naan is so amazing (as are all your recipes!).  I&#8217;ve made it twice now &#8211; it&#8217;s so easy, pillowy soft in the middle with a beautiful crust on the outside.  My family goes CRAZY for this naan, they gobble every single piece down and there are never any leftovers (much to my chagrin)."

				"Hello Eva, I made this today and it is pure heaven. I\u2019ve made caramel sauce and toffee before but that was when I was a vegetarian and using dairy. So great to be able to make a vegan version. I did make a mistake and used coconut cream from a fridged can of coconut milk \ud83d\ude02. I realised this as it was cooling down. So in fact I made toffee \ud83d\ude01. But I just added some oat milk and it is right as rain. Thank you for your lovely recipe. x",
				"@Rebecca, hello Rebecca, I just made this for the first time. I made sure my butter was really soft. When I added it to the melted sugar mine clumped into toffee but I kept stirring like mad and it finally mixed. Give it another try it\u2019s pure heaven.",
				"Great recipe. \nI&#8217;m not normally one to leave comments.\nTop tip for cleaning out a caramel pan is to just add water to it and bring to a boil, all the sugar dissolves into the water. No Scrubbing.",
				"This is soooooo good! I used the country crock vegan butter and I think it may have too much water in it because I had a hard time getting it to come together; it did in the end but I think I overcooked it in the process- next time I&#8217;ll use earth balance for sure, I was just being cheap because it&#8217;s more expensive than the country crock haha. It was still SUPER delicious!! I have used it in lattes and as a dip for apples and honestly sometimes I just eat a spoonful of it when I remember that it is hanging out in the fridge! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Just made this and it is delicious! I didn\u2019t have any coconut milk on hand, so I used 1/4 regular soy milk and 1/4 room temp earth balance butter. The finished product was a little thick when cooled, but still usable as a dipping sauce. If I made this again I would use the coconut milk just to get the consistency right.",

In love with that \u201cmozzarella\u201d sauce, so easy and quick to make:)) I didn\u2019t have vegan sausage crumbles on hand so I just used finely chopped cremini mushroom, red bell pepper, broccoli stems along with roughly smashed left over lentils. This will be now my new go to dish for entertaining. Thanks!!",

Sometimes I add spinach &amp; mushrooms too, but it\u2019s so good even on its own. I\u2019m making it this week for the maybe 6th time and I\u2019m so excited to have it again!",

I used a vitamix with all the ingredients as listed (tapioca flour that was labeled as \u201calso called tapioca starch\u201d), but mine looks a lot thicker than your pics. What did I do wrong? I haven\u2019t baked it yet so I don\u2019t know about the taste.",

My boyfriend and I sometimes make it as often as once a week and it is always my go to when I have meat eaters/non-vegans over and they are always so impressed! The mozzarella sauce is amazing and it thickens up so much in the oven. Absolutely love it and it is no joke one of my favorite recipes!",

				"I really want to make this but I genuinely cannot find refined coconut oil anywhere anymore &#8211; I used to rely on it so heavily for baking, but for the last year it seems like everywhere no longer stocks it, which has thrown me for a loop. Has anyone actually has success trying this without coconut oil, or subbed for something else?",
				"This recipe is *amazing*, thank you for sharing! It&#8217;s definitely a favorite in my household \ud83d\ude42 I keep experimenting based on what I have available (type of sausage or tomatoes) &#8211; the mozzarella sauce really brings it together. It&#8217;s my go-to mozarella sauce now!",

I\u2019m sure that if it is anything like the mozzarella it is awesome.  I doubled the recipe and fed 4 non vegan men , plus my self and my husband. They were in heaven and could not believe there was no cheese or meat when I told them. All had. second helping and lucky for me I still had some leftovers. I am now dreaming of vegan meatball sandwiches with that amazing mozzarella sauce.",
				"I LOVE this recipe! It\u2019s been a hit with my non-vegan family (including my Italian grandma)!\nI skip the oil in the cheese sauce and I\u2019ve been skipping the sausage. I love using San Marzano tomatoes. I didn\u2019t find it necessary to put them through the food processor, I just break them up a bit with the spatula as they cook.\nLast night was my 4th time making it, it was a double batch and everyone got seconds!

Thanks for sharing the recipe, it\u2019s a firm family favourite and I\u2019m looking forward to serving it at an upcoming dinner party.

				"I am not a cook but reading how easy this recipe is I made it without using my family as guinea pigs. It was delicious, everyone loved it, even meat eaters.

He can add more later if he wants.   Really great recipe!",

I would say after the initial 25 minute bake &#8211; follow-up with a 5 minute bake instead of the full 10 to avoid it being overly crispy. Otherwise 10/10 recipe!!!!!",
				"I must have done something slightly wrong. The taste was great and the breaded tofu was super crispy&#8230;until I threw them in the mixing bowl and tossed them in the sauce. They became very soggy. Still tasted great and will be good on salad, but not exactly what I was ho[ing for.",

				"This recipe is just the best. You can change up the seasonings and hot sauces and it&#8217;s still fantastic.  Can&#8217;t stop sharing it with my friends.",
				"I have never posted a review on a recipe before but this was great!! Will for sure make again. Thank you!",

				"I didn&#8217;t have any breadcrumbs so I used oats and put them in a food processor. Weren&#8217;t crispy but I still loved it!!!!",
				"Made these tonight and they were lovely! Used regular bread crumbs, maybe not *as* crispy but still delicious! Made them in my toaster over and broiled them to crisp them up more. Dipped them in a quick home made tzatziki. I&#8217;ll definitely be making them again!\nThanks Eva, can&#8217;t wait to check out more of your recipes (:",

				"Just tried these vegan tofu bites. They are absolutely delicious. Ever since giving up meat buffalo chicken was one of the things that I really missed\u2026 These definitely do it for me. I made these for my husband\u2019s birthday along with some vegan mac &amp; cheese for a southern style birthday dinner. Definitely super excited for these. They will definitely be becoming part of our regular meal lineup yet. Thank you so much for this recipe",
				"I was so impressed with this recipe! It tasted so good and the texture was great. The only issue I had was I felt like they tasted too buttery, next time is probably use little to no vegan butter and just stick with dipping them in the hot sauce. I will definitely be making these again though and was still so pleased with how they turned out \ud83d\ude42",
				"I actually have the same question.  I would like to try these with tempeh, I feel like this would give it more texture.  Any feedback from someone who has tried the recipe with tempeh would be appreciated.",

				"Definitely a late reply, but we&#8217;ve used convection bake on our air fryer to dramatically cut the cooking time on these &#8211; something like 8 minutes with no flip required.",
				"Do you think this same recipe could be used for cauliflower?or  tempeh? One of our favorite places does tempeh wings and they&#8217;re so nice and crispy (obviously fried!) but we&#8217;d love to try a healthier version.",
				"This was amazing! I made a batch and then made more later in the week it was just so good. We ate it as a salad with blue cheese- which I have never liked before. It was very good with this. I just used the franks buffalo sauce as the sauce for the tofu and it was delicious and easy. I think the base recipe of the tofu sticks would be great with other sauces too- a lemon-y sauce to make a vegan lemon chicken.",
				"I don\u2019t know what I did wrong!! I was so excited to eat these and they ended up just tasting like cornstarch. I used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko, but don\u2019t think that should make too much of a difference. ???",
				"These exceeded my expectations. Buffalo wings are my number 1 craving, and these were fantastic. I served them in wraps with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and avocado. A creamy dressing would pair beautifully. As a vegan buffalo wing recipe 10/10 would recommend. Can&#8217;t wait to try the recipe with other sauces, too. Thank you!",
				"I am so impressed with this recipe! I made it using Frank&#8217;s new Buffalo Wings sauce. I forgot the 2 Tbsp. olive oil in the panko mixture but the tofu still turned out crispy and delicious. I did have to flip the wings about 15 minutes in to avoid browning them too much, but that could be a result of the lack of oil. They turned out very spicy and fantastic with light ranch dressing.\nThank you so much!",
				"These were soooo gooood &#8211; thank you!",
				"Just made this recipe and absolutely *loved* it. My husband isn&#8217;t keen on tofu, but I think I&#8217;ve got him hooked on this recipe. We absolutely adored the base tofu recipe without the sauce. The sauce nearly killed my hubby&#8217;s sensitive taste buds, so I had to tame it a bit. I will definitely be making this again though.",

				"We are a newly vegetarian couple and my boyfriends son is still a meat-eater. He had no idea this wasn\u2019t chicken or that the dressing (we used Daiya) was vegan!  We used regular butter instead of vegan butter bc it\u2019s what we had. But we LOVED this recipe!",
				"Omg these are soo damn good.!",
				"I was a bit disappointed with all the positive reviews.  It was decent but I feel the actual tofu needed some kind of  marinade for it to make me want to make it again.",
				"Can I use regular bread crumbs instead of the panko? Thanks.",
				"This turned out amazing! I didn\u2019t have \u201cfollow your heart\u201d ranch or blue cheese, but I do have vegannaise, mrs dash onion &amp; herb, and unsweetened soy milk on hand. That makes a great ranch dressing in a pinch. \ud83d\ude09",
				"I was in search of a baked tofu french fry recipe when I found this! Looks so good &#8211; I&#8217;m definitely going to try it! But how do you think this would be without the buffalo sauce, just as a good basic crunchy fry recipe?",
				"Just made these! So so good!!!",
				"What should I do to reheat it?",
				"Made these buffalo tofu wings for the family last night &#8211; they were soooo crispy and delicious. Everyone loved them dipped in Follow Your Heart Bleu Cheese style dressing.  Let&#8217;s just say there were no leftovers!  Yum Yum, Eva!",
				"Is it possible to skip on adding oil? ?",
				"Girrrrrllll! This recipe is incredible!  I\u2019m not a picky eater but rarely does a dish make me want to dance on the table. I didn\u2019t, but I wanted to. We had the wings on greens, topped sweet peppers, celery and cherry tomatoes. I thought I would never again get to eat buffalo style food but this has brought new hope. Now I have something to eat on \u201cgame day\u201d besides guacamole and chips. My roomies (who aren\u2019t vegan) loved it too and want me to make it again soon. Thank you so much! .",

Both times my breads were soft and fluffy, and the outside toasted just enough to form a sweet crust. I did make some tweaks. I used coconut oil instead of vegan butter, doubled the sugar and I put in a touch of turmeric as I&#8217;ve seen in other recipes, to Yellow the bread a little. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I used another blogger&#8217;s recipe for vegan cream cheese frosting and it wasn&#8217;t as creamy as I&#8217;d have liked, I guess due to having no vegan butter included.

And I would suggest mixing the mac noodles and sauce in a separate pan, reserve some of the sauce. Cook the bacon til pretty crisp, then remove from the pan. In a nice cast iron pan, heat up a bit of oil, then add a few servings of mac and cheese, a thin layer. Let it toast, turn once, and then add plenty of the bacon right at the end so it\u2019s still crispy. At Upton\u2019s, their mac is more dry, so I that\u2019s why I\u2019ll reserve some of the sauce next time. A bit more dry to get that crisp on it. Maybe some toasted breadcrumbs to finish it? It was absolutely delish. So happy that you were able to capture the strong cheesy flavor in that sauce! Can\u2019t wait to re-crisp the leftovers tomorrow, maybe I\u2019ll grab some more bacon and add that too! Thanks again, very enjoyable, and saved me a trip to the city!"

				"This was my first homemade Indian dish. After I found all the ingredients &#8211; I live near a big Indian neighborhood &#8211; I was surprised at how simple the recipe was to prepare. I don&#8217;t have anything to compare it with, since I&#8217;ve never tried it anywhere, but this was delicious! Looking at other recipes, and from what I&#8217;ve probably seen on Indian restaurant buffets, Chana Masala looks soupy. I&#8217;m glad this one wasn&#8217;t, but I had to stir it frequently to keep it from sticking. I used dried garbanzos, soaked overnight and cooked, added a couple extra red chili peppers, and served it with brown basmati rice. I will be making this often, since I now have a lifetime supply of Indian spices. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
				"My family\u2019s Christmas Eve tradition is to gather with our Jewish friends for Indian food. So this year, I made Eva\u2019s chana masala, biryani, raita, and mango lassi for a feast at home. These are, by far, absolutely the most delicious Indian recipes I\u2019ve ever made &#8211; and I\u2019ve made recipes from many sources. I&#8217;ve finally found my go-to chana masala recipe now &#8211; no need for all the others I&#8217;ve tried over the years! Thank you, Eva &#8211; I will come back to your recipes again and again!",
				"definitely it is looking restaurant like chana masala. and I am sure it would taste like one. I always prefer to use tomato instead of amchur I hope this is ok. is it? thank you for sharing this blog.",
				"Great recipe. I used about 2 pounds of fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and 1 tbsp tamarind concentrate instead of mango powder. The sauce was slightly on the acidic side, so I added 1/2 tsp sugar to balance it out.",
				"Great recipe, must warn though that amchur is strong stuff indeed. I put in a heaped teaspoon and at first I thought \u201cmy goodness, tastes of cleaning powder\u201d. Next time maybe half a teaspoon for me. Perhaps more garum masala, a teaspoon or even two. A little more methi maybe.\nIt\u2019s all taste though of course and this is an awesome recipe, thanks again \ud83d\ude42",
				"Wow&#8230; amazing description and details&#8230;",
				"If I want to make a smaller batch (for 2 people) should I reduce the amount of spices accordingly? I.e if making half the batch, should I use half the amount of spices? Thank you! So excited to make this!!",
				"I made this recipe, trying to stick to the recipe as close as I could, and it turned out fantastic. Thanks for sharing this one!",
				"Lacking pomi, I ran a can of diced tomatoes through a blender with 2 tbsp plain tomato paste with good results.  Next time I&#8217;ll leave out the cayenne and add a minced jalapeno.  Dutch oven on the stove top at moderate temperature, it came out great.  Thank you.",
				"Wow!  This was amazing.  I used 3 peppers and it was the perfect heat.  I served this dish with curried fried rice&#8230;. just delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!!",
				"This is a delicious and flavorful recipe. But don\u2019t add the full amount of spices unless you want a burning hot dish. I had to add more chickpeas, two more cans of diced tomatoes, and coconut milk to dilute it enough to eat. But it is a great recipe and very simple to prepare. Just adjust the seasons to the level of spiciness you prefer.",
				"A bit too much tomato for my taste, otherwise very nice",
				"I bought a garam masala spice mix. Im wondering how much i should use as it has all the spices blended together. Thanks",
				"Do you skin your chickpeas before adding them to the masala? Also would crushed red pepper flakes work as a sub for the dried red hot chilies? Thank you!",
				"I prefer to cook my chickpeas rather than use a can. Have you ever done that? Looking at the recipe it looks like I would only need to leave out the salt until the end. Thoughts?",
				"This dish is soooo great! We serve it with long grain brown rice and its just the perfect mix and so hearty. I have tried your lentil bolognese too and its so good! Love, love, love your recipes. I can&#8217;t wait to try more!! Thanks for making it easy and delicious to eat vegan : )",
				"WHAT can I sub for the carton of strained tomatoes? An equally size can of diced tomatoes or crushed ones?",
				"If I don&#8217;t have cardamom pods, can I substitute ground cardamom, and if so, how much?",
				"Husband has a mango allergy. How about substituting Anardana powder instead?",
				"Followed exactly. This is the best C.M. recipe I\u2019ve ever made. It will be my new go-to. Thanks!!",
				"Oops, forgot to rate this tasty dish!",
				"Whoa, this recipe is SO delicious! I made it tonight and my whole family loved it!!!  The flavours were out of this world!  Thanks for another amazing recipe, Eva!!!"

I was skeptical that the tempeh would stick together, but it went together just like your photos. We are putting on the grill. The slaw is really worth it and I made the gochuchang mayo for the bun. All that&#8217;s left is the grill meister&#8217;s deft touch and we&#8217;ll be in Gochuchang heaven soon,\nthanks for a great recipe,\nSusan"

				"Can you freeze the gnocchi before cooking?",
				"Always thought gnocchi above my skill level.  After reading this recipe and watching the video decided to give a try.  The step by step detailed instructions made it a breeze.  Came out perfect the very 1st attempt!   Baked Gnocchi with Arrabbiata and Vegan Mozzarella on the menu tonight.",
				"Hi! Do you think I can use instant mashed potatoes and it will work?",
				"I made I small batch of these delicious \ud83d\ude0b gnocchi for the #danielfast and they were great so I stayed up until about 3:00am making more for my family for dinner Tomorrow. Since there are six of us I was rolling and cutting dough for quite a while but it is worth it! I love this and I wish I could add pictures because they came out great!",
				"Okay. I love this recipe. I&#8217;m so happy to have found a vegan recipe for gnocchi! I followed the instructions (though didn&#8217;t weigh my potatoes :/ ) and got a pretty good result. However, the dough had a hard time staying together, even when I added a ton more olive oil. After perusing the comments a bit I see others had the same problem when using gluten-free flour, which I did. The remedy seems to be adding a couple flax &#8220;eggs&#8221; to bind the dough. I will definitely try that next time I make this, cuz I definitely want to try again!\nOh also, even though I struggled to get the gnocchi to stay in shape, they held together just fine when cooking. The end result was super sticky because of all the oil I used, so I laid them out to dry a bit on a sheet of parchment paper so that they didn&#8217;t all glob together.",
				"This was pretty good.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the flavor of olive oil with some foods.  This is one of them.  The next time I do this recipe (cuz I will) I&#8217;ll use grapeseed oil or something like that. I&#8217;m also thinking of plant based butter with this.  I paired this with a vegan mushroom sauce. I&#8217;ll def try it again!!",
				"Could I use oat flour instead?\nThank you",
				"I&#8217;ve had trouble making vegan gnocchi in the past, it has been very hard to roll out and hasn&#8217;t bound properly. I love this recipe! I peeled then boiled my potatoes because I find it easier that way, and I had excellent results \ud83d\ude42",
				"Thank you for posting this recipe. It was super easy and informative. I made it yesterday and my gnocchi came out great. ?\u2764",
				"Please, what is contained in All Purpose Flour. My husband is allergic to wheat, and I have just bought my first bag of Gram Flour.\nTIA. Jjanette",
				"I did 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular potato. I forgot that I was low on AP flour so I had to use mostly whole wheat flour. I put in way more than 2.5 cups flour and it was STILL sticky. I ran out of whole wheat flour too, and it was still way too sticky to shape, so I had to throw it out unfortunately.",
				"it says above the recipe\n You can reheat cooked gnocchi either in the sauce it\u2019s being served in, or by blanching briefly in boiling water. You can also toast it on the stove in a bit of olive oil\nHope this helps",
				"I made these gnocchi and they were absolutely delicious. I am so pleased with this recipe and the result. I tried to make gnocchi once before and it was a disaster, so am really chuffed with the result tonight. I also crisped them in olive oil and added them to saut\u00e9ed garlic, spinach, red sweet pepper and chilli with some vegan rashers thrown in. Vegan Parmesan sprinkled on top. Oh so yummy ?",
				"I tried this and really worked!\nMy little one has gluten  allergy and I could never make fresh pasta.\nThis was so delicious and she loved it.\nThank you",
				"Just use gluten free flour",
				"Tried this recipe. Way too much flour in my opinion. I would recommend starting with 1cup.",
				"It is a great recipe! So easy ( a bit long, but hey, I&#8217;m not complaining) simple and fun to make! I really enjoyed making gnocchi for the first time. I roasted the potatoes on my microwave and they had the perfect texture ( although I killed the microwave in the process of cooking the last potato&#8230;) But seriously, it is really good thank you for the recipe. \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi. Do you think this would work with Yukon gold potatoes? Thanks.",
				"This recipe was perfect. I don&#8217;t have anything else to say, thanks for the help \ud83d\ude42",
				"I made them yesterday and they were delicious! But I definitely disagree here. The ammount I got was for serving 4 people very well, or 5 or 6 people with a decent size plate without repeating. I served it with tomato sauce and veggies",
				"Planning to make gnocchi tomorrow. Can\u2019t wait.. recipe looks easy enough and you have walked Us through the possible pitfalls.",
				"Hi there! I\u2019m hoping to make this for dinner tonight, how many people does this recipe serve? Thanks!",
				"Can I freeze the gnocchi?",
				"Thank you so much Daniel. I JUST got your reply today, 2/3/2020 and that is the only reason you did not hear from me sooner. God Bless you for the info &lt;3",
				"Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I served this in a pesto soup and people loved it!",
				"I just made them with Pamela&#8217;s all-porpoise GF flour. The dough broke apart so I added a couple &#8220;vegan eggs&#8221; for a binder and that helped hold the dough together. To make a vegan egg just combine  2 tbsp flax seed and 6 tbsp warm water and let sit for 5 minutes. Dump that into the dough and it will help bind.",
				"How would you reheat these once cooked and cooled? Microwave or hot water?",
				"Need a gluten-free vegan version please&#8230;..love gnocchi and hated giving them up",
				"OMG I have just found this as I am moving towards a vegan lifestyle and they are amazing and |I love your passion for Gnocchi, it mirrors my own.  I will bookmark you, but I will make this recipe soon x",

				"Nice recipe but i wanted to mention that your &#8220;classic&#8221; wonton shape, while perfectly functional, is not the real wonton shape. For real chinese wontons you place teaspoon of filling just above one corner of wrapper, fold corner over filling, roll to tuck point under. Moisten two side corners and pull them together behind filled corner and overlap slightly, pinch together to seal. This leaves a nice floaty little tail. Takes a little practice but just as easy once you get the hang of it. Of course you can also just pinch corner to corner for a triangle shape before sticking ends together or stick with the rectangle shape like youve done. In the end the only things that really matter are that they taste delicious and are cruelty free!",
				"So amazing! We had some leftover wonton wrappers and needed to use them up, and since then they&#8217;ve been a staple. We added maybe 5x the amount of scallions because we&#8217;re fiends for the stuff. We pan fried then steamed for the crunch and chew and OMG.",
				"Delicious!!  I haven\u2019t had wonton soup in years and now I\u2019m so happy to have a vegan recipe for the wontons I remember from chinese restaurants before I went vegan!  I froze the rest of the batch and plan to test a few in the air fryer later this week- I will update with the results.  Thank you Eva!",

I have three 8-inch cake pans so that I can make a three-layer cake, does that mean that I have to triple the amount on the &#8220;1 8-inch cake&#8221; recipe? And therefore use 600 grams of flour for example, is that correct? \nJust wondering because I really want this cake to turn out good! Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi there,i am needing to make this cake GF. Is there a alternative you can suggest for the flour and would i use the same measurement?",
				"Hi!\nI just made this but haven\u2019t tasted it yet. The batter was REALLY thick and the resulting baked layers seem a little dry. I have to of course still taste it but is the batter supposed to be sooo thick?? I had to spread it in the pan with an offset knife",
				"This cake was just the perfect texture and turned out beautifully.  My most successful attempt at making a vegan layer cake.  In the past, the cake had always turned out very dense &#8211; but the use of baking soda/powder with vinegar really did the trick &#8211; even with heavy ingredients like walnuts and carrots.  \nI thought my cream cheese frosting was going to be an epic fail.  I used &#8220;Better than Cream Cheese&#8221; by Tofutti and when I tried to whip it with the vegan butter, the cream cheese began to separate. I had milking water along with blobs of fat. Perhaps the cream cheese should have sat out longer to get to room temperature. But I trusted the process, and as I added the first cup of the powdered sugar, the cornstarch in the sugar fixed everything and it all came together beautifully.\nI used almond paste instead of marzipan for the carrots (because that&#8217;s what I had on hand) and it worked just fine.  Using parsley for the carrot tops is an inspiration. \nI can&#8217;t thank you enough for the recipe and all the decorating tips and tricks.",
				"This was the BEST carrot cake I\u2019ve had in a long time\u2014vegan or not. It lasted only one day in my house! So delicious! I had to cut the amount of salt in half. Not sure if that\u2019s because the recipe was meant to call for kosher salt and I was using registrable salt. I will definitely make this again!",
				"The taste of this cake was incredible however my sponge came out ever so slightly too dry and I wonder why that could be? Or if there are any slight changes I could make? I used a fan assisted oven but otherwise everything was exactly the same. I checked it about 5 minutes before I took it out and the skewer came out with a little batter on it, then after the further 5 minutes the skewer came out clean but as I said, slightly too dry. Any suggestions?\nThanks soooo much for this recipe!",

				"Which measurements should i follow if i was doing 3 6 inch pans?",
				"Thanks for replying. I made it before you replied. I did the single 8 inch divided into 2 pans and it was actually perfect. Cooked for 20 mins though. Probably the most delicious carrot cake I have ever eaten",
				"Totally confused by the number of tins/slices this recipe makes.\nDoes the amount for an 8 inch cake = divided into 2 sandwich tins? Or for 2 sandwich tins do I need to do the receipt quantity for \u201c2 cakes\u201d?",

It\u2019s even better than some non-vegan ones that I have tried in the past. \nI made it into a loaf using the 2 x 8 inch recipe and baked it for about 80 minutes and it was so good we devoured half of it when it came out of the oven!

My family loved it and they couldn\u2019t believe it was vegan.\nThe only adjustment I made was that I added less sugar than called for in the vegan cream cheese frosting (5 cups) and it was still too sweet for me, but I\u2019m very sensitive to sweets and just have to adjust to my liking.\nThank you so much for sharing!"

				"Thank you for this recipe, Eva!  This is the best chili I&#8217;ve made, vegan or not.  You&#8217;re right, the tvp adds A LOT. I try to keep my meals lower-sodium so I used lower-sodium crushed tomatoes, and home-made no-salt beans.\nI&#8217;ve eaten this chili so far once topped with sauerkraut, and once topped with tofutti. Hard to tell which I liked better. \ud83d\ude42\nMy mom and my kids (6, 6, and 9 yrs old) love this recipe too!",
				"I didn&#8217;t have pinto beans so I used one can each of red kidney, white cannellini, black eyed peas and black beans. I also threw in an extra tbsp of cocoa just because I thought the flavour would be interesting as well as some frozen corn which was on the cusp of freezer burn (didn&#8217;t want to toss it)\nI hadn&#8217;t noticed that ran out of chili powder and the shops were closed, so I subbed with two tsp of Sambal Oelek (Indonesian chili paste). It surprised me how good it tastes!. Managed to get 9-500 ml jars from this recipe, so there&#8217;s a goodly number of frozen meals for me. I&#8217;m trying to eat no to very low oil, so only using 1 tbsp of oil to cook the onions and garlic was fine with me. \nOverall I&#8217;d give this two spoons up!! DELICIOUS!",

When using cast iron you usually want to use a dutch oven, that is have a lid that can absorb heat as well.\nmy suggestion is to heat the cast iron first and with a peel drop the pizza into the pan so you can use the heat of the pan to do the cooking, and, make it well covered with a lid of some sort, any pan / lid is better than foil and it should work well.",
				"@thecuriouschickpea, \nFreezing dough happens after the final proofing. When you thaw it out it will be ready to shape and use.",
				"@Tony, \nUnless you are using a brick yeast, rapid rise is perfectly fine. The difference is you just do not need to proof it first.",
				"Hi Eva,\nThank you for the recipe! This was my first time making pizza dough. It turned out great! Can&#8217;t wait to do it again&#8230;\nCouple questions though. At any time do I need to punch the dough down? Not sure why even. Lol. And can I add seasonings to the dough?\nThank you,\nJohn",
				"Hello and thank you for the recipe.  Can I make a whole wheat version of this?",
				"@Gary Hewett &#8212; Gary is the epitome of a male Karen.",
				"@Eva Agha, I believe the only difference between instant and active yeast is that instant yeast has smaller granules with some yeast activator. This allows you to add it directly to the dough. If you follow the directions on your active yeast (add to water and wait) then you should get the same result as if you had used instant yeast.",
				"I followed this recipe carefully yesterday and it turned out perfectly!\nI made a half recipe and let it sit in my fridge for the minimum 6 hours. My dough sat perfectly in my 12 inch pizza pan.\nIt was simple, easy, and satisfying! I will definitely be making this again. Maybe for some calzones..  \ud83d\ude42\nThank you!",
				"@Meghan White, I did not mean to write this in caps!! also I am not comfortable having my email posted here publicly, can you please remove this?",
				"WHAT BIZZAR DIRECTION, I WISH I READ STEP TWO BEFORE STARTING THIS RECIPE. YOUR &#8216;PINCHING&#8217; TECHNIQUE IS CONFUSING AND AN EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION. IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE SUCH BIZAR DOUGH MAKING DIRECTIONS I RECOMMEND POSTING MORE PICTURES OF THE PROCESS&#8230;",
				"I just attempted this recipe. When I go to reach my hands into the bowl after first mixing with a wooden spoon, my hands get covered in dough &#8211; despite wetting them thoroughly first. I weighed out the flour according to your recipe and double checked the water amount but it seems insanely wet. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to be able to knead this without adding a bunch more flour in. What am I doing wrong?",
				"This recipe was perfect! Thank you for explaining the importance of extra hydration for pizza going into a home oven as opposed to a high heat pizza or commercial oven. Also thanks for the tips on the pizza peel. I do. It have a peel but I applied the same principles to a flat baking sheet and it worked wonderfully. We divided the pizza dough in 2, made one large pizza for the 2 of us and froze the second for another time, and I can\u2019t wait! Literally so excited over this recipe",
				"Hello, \nI just wanted to know if I could do the kneading using a stand mixer? \nThank you!!",
				"@Eva Agha, yay! Thanks so much for responding so quickly!",
				"Hi I hope you see this tonight and are able to comment back. I was planning on using this recipe and just skimmed through for the ingredients at the store. Then I started reading everything when I got home and saw where it said this is a wetter dough because it\u2019s made for an oven and longer cooking time. I am making this for my dad\u2019s house tomorrow and he has an outdoor brick oven. So this will only be cooked about 1-3 minutes at around 800 degrees. Will this still work!? Thank you!",
				"I understand this is an old post and you may not see this but I\u2019m gonna ask anyway\u2026 Do you have a video or pictures steps to describe the pinching and pulling that seem to be a required step? I can\u2019t seem to figure out what you mean! Or perhaps you know of another similar recipe that already has a video?",
				"I know sugar is not needed but I tend to like a touch of sweetness. Can I add a pinch of sugar or will it throw off the rising process? And if it&#8217;s ok to add, when and how much for the touch of sweetness",
				"Just to confirm, do you freeze it after letting it sit in the fridge overnight, or before that?",
				"Hi, I was making a half batch, but I can&#8217;t achieve the smooth dough with 2 cup all purpose and 3/4 water. Should I add more water?",
				"Wow!  What an arrogant jerk you are sir!!!!\nBloody hell!",
				"Question about fridge storing. I left the dough in the fridge for 3 days because&#8230; Reasons. I pinched it down once during the 3 days. On day 3 I took it out and I noticed a sour odor and a small amount of hootch like a sourdough starter. Has this happened to you and did you still use the dough?",
				"Oh man, this recipe was a total dud for me! I&#8217;m posting in hopes anyone has some advice.\nI have been making a lot of homemade pizza since March and they have all turned out amazing but this is the first overnight dough i have made and it was awful, so if anyone who hasnt tried making this yet is reading it, please beware. \nThis recipe seemed doomed from the start, are the water and flour ratios correct? When I put in 1.5cups water and FOUR cups of flour it was just a hard lumpy mass. Literally unkneadable, and looked nothing like the nice wet slack dough in the video. I triple read the instructions after to make sure I didn&#8217;t misread anything but alas, that is in fact the ratio. Just to get the dough to a kneadable state, i had to basically double the water amount. I had a feeling from this time that it was in trouble but i still followed all the instructions and wait times just in case a miracle happened (it did not).\nAfter the overnight rise, when i took the dough ball out it wasnt a cohesive dough, you could clearly separate the dough from where i folded it onto itself from the day before (again, i think the dough was too dry despite my extra water). After priming my oven, i stretch the dough, topped it, and baked.\nThe pizza was edible, but the dough was just so dense and hard and didnt rise very much at all. I may try and make it again just to see but I also dont want to waste ingredients. \nI did double check my measurements and this has never been a problem for me with any of the other multiple recipes i have used.",
				"Hi!\nI\u2019ve been no the hunt to make the perfect pizza dough, so I\u2019m very excited to try this recipe! I don\u2019t have instant yeast, only Red Star Active Dry Yeast. How would you recommend I modify this recipe until I can get instant yeast?\nThank you.",
				"Could you add olive oil to this dough recipe please?",
				"Hi I\u2019m looking to prepare pizza bases ahead of a party for around 30 people, say 50 individual 9 inch pizzas?\nWhat would you recommend to limit work on the day? Can I \u2018roll\u2019 or stretch the bases the day before and keep refrigerated- would I put these on greaseproof paper/keep them oiled?\nWe will be using our outdoor kitchen to cook &#8211; a kamado BBQ and a dedicated wood burning pizza oven with stone &#8211; any tips to ensure a thin crust that doesn\u2019t stick?\nWe plan to practise loads in the time running up to it &#8211; do you have a video that goes long with this recipe? Thanks \ud83d\ude42",
				"Gary Hewett&#8217;s recipe can&#8217;t be all that great if he&#8217;s looking for a new and improved dough recipe. I have just popped my dough in the fridge for tomorrow night. Thank you for the recipe,and advice.",
				"Hello, will this dough work with wholewheat flour?",
				"Hi! What would be the measure for a homemade natural yeast?\nAnd also you don\u2019t add olive oil or sugar to the beginning of the dough right?\nTkss",
				"Can I have the substitute if using fresh yeast",
				"do you pre bake the dough before adding the toppings and sauce? and how long should i bake the pizza for ?",
				"I am planning to try this recipe later this week. Should I use the convection function or regular? Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
				"I found my house was a bit cold for the yeast to rise I think &#8211; after 2 hours it hadn&#8217;t done much. I heated my oven to 105f, turned it off, and stuck my covered bowl in and voila &#8211; an hour later I had lots of rise!",
				"Oops! Wrote this in the review!\nAbsolutely loved the dough! I made the exact recipe and made two dough balls. We had one tonight and the other one we want to save to make two calzones. If so, would you recommend cooking at the same time as the pizza, 550? Anyways, delicious recipe. Thank you!!!",
				"All I have on hand is rapid rise yeast. Could I lower the amount of yeast, let\u2019s say 1/8  Tsp. Of rapids rise since that\u2019s all I have on hand for this recipe. I can\u2019t get my hands a regular yeast. they are sold out everywhere because of covid-19 lockdown. Thank you, stay safe and god bless!!",
				"I like to use fresh ground flour, do you have any suggestions for variations using fresh ground hard winter wheat?  I also live in Colorado so higher hydration in dough is essential, otherwise the water evaporates during the rise and doughs are too dry.  Thank you for any tips! I will be making this dough for family pizza dinner for Easter!!  The kids all get to top their own pizza.",
				"My sourdough starter is having an off day so I tried out this recipe instead! However I used fresh yeast..  hope this doesn&#8217;t upset the recipe too much. \nThe dough seems incredibly wet though and I can&#8217;t stop it sticking all over my hands resulting in dough covered flour bags!\nI&#8217;m now waiting for  an hour for it to rise before shaping it into 3 then leaving in the fridge for dinner tomorrow.  I hope it will be a bit more manageable! \nWish me luck! \ud83d\ude00",
				"Is there any way to substitute an ingredient for yeast?  Don&#8217;t have any on hand in my pantry.",
				"Trying my hand at this now, I wish there were more pictures for each step. I make bread a lot, but this is my first time making pizza dough. How much of a rise should I be expecting? For bread it&#8217;s very visible, but so far I don&#8217;t see much of anything with my dough. Right now I&#8217;m at the 1-2 hour bulk fermentation. \nAlso, when putting the balls into the fridge, will they stay in balls or kind of flatten out? Will the continue to rise while in the fridge? I&#8217;m trying to figure out the best way to do it because I made 3 batches so I will have a total of 6 balls. It seems easier to put them all onto a floured baking sheet rather than 6 plates, but I don&#8217;t want to do that and then have them all flatten out and lump together.. What are your thoughts? Thanks!",
				"My dough has not risen at all.",
				"I had great success with this, especially with a steel. I&#8217;m making it again, but I still don&#8217;t quite understand the &#8220;shaping the dough&#8221; step. I don&#8217;t know what shape I&#8217;m supposed to end up with when storing it for a few days. Am I stretching it then reforming to a ball? \nAlso do you think you could freeze this?",
				"Wow, I&#8217;m astonished that someone would be so rude!",
				"Gary,\n    Your critique is as bad as your parent&#8217;s failure to raise a kind and intelligent human being. Please kindly return to what ever troll cave you were born in and stay away from us humans, thanks.",
				"As someone that is an accomplished pizza-bread maker, I tried the overnight pizza dough recipe to see how it stacked up against my regular dough and was fully underwhelmed. I can only assume the worst, such as that, these amazed at the results of overnight pizza dough makers are the same people that make up the contestants on the Americas Worst Cooks show! I was up for a new and improved dough recipe but this wasn&#8217;t it. I can do much better with my regular method in a few hours.It had very little to recommend as an improvement, 1 item actually. The dough was pliable and easy to work, but had no flavor to add to the finished pizza! Certainly not worth the added effort. Get a Pizza stone an a oven that will hold 500 degrees, for your best shot at it. An additional issue might be that low expectations!!!",
				"Your pizza dough looks absolutely perfect. Will have to give this a try.",
				"Can you use all purpose gluten free flour?  I have not perfected a gf pizza . Yet",
				"What vegan cheese did you use for this pizza?",
				"I\u2019m planning to make a large batch for a party and had few questions. When making a large batch of dough , did you do any additional kneading before bulk fermentation, or just put the dough in fridge? Did you shape the balls the day you make pizzas and use it immediately or did you let it warm  up and ferment some more before shaping?",
				"I agree. I search and search and wish I could find this exact kind of recipe (slow rise/ferment in the fridge) but just want a yield of one pizza. It obviously saves time to make a big batch but I can&#8217;t get through three pizzas in as many days and I&#8217;ve had rotten luck with freezing and defrosting pizza dough.",
				"I wish this recipe instructed on the amount of ingredients for just one pizza. I don&#8217;t want or need multiple doughs.",
				"I was planning to make pizza for a party of around 50 freinds and needed to make the dough a day before. Found this recipe and it was perfect. I made *10 the quantity in one batch, which was tough, but made around 15-18 14&#8243; pizzas (I lost count) In a steel pizza oven. I didn&#8217;t separate the dough into individual pizzas before hand because of the quantity, instead I kept it in 2 halfs in large bags with plenty oil, which was fine. The dough was the best I have made and everyone at the party went crazy for it, so much air in the crust. The main plus of this is how good it tastes and that thin or thick crust are both delicious, which is not always th case (with some recipes favouring thin or thick). From now on this will be my go to recipe. Thanks a lot for making the part a success. Wish I could share photos.",
				"This was wonderful! We made a deep dish and two thins with the recipe. No one knew it was a vegan recipe until I told them. The instructions were easy to follow and the taste was fantastic. Thank you for helping this journey of a new lifestyle (no dairy and no eggs) be one that is easier to do than I thought.",
				"Thanks for the recipe!\nI am planning to prepare dough for 10 people, each having their own 10&#8243; pizza. Would you recommend tripling the recipe to fit this quantity?\nI will also be cooking these over campfire coals in cast iron pans, oiled, and covered with aluminum foil. I was planning to use the high heat of direct contact with the coals and to cook for about 5 minutes. Do you have any insight into how I may best achieve thoroughly cooked dough?\nThanks again!",
				"Hi! Can you freeze the dough if you dont use it all?",
				"We do pizza every Friday so I can&#8217;t wait to try this out! It looks so easy!",
				"Great recipe? Have you tried using bread flour?",
				"I rarely review recipes, but I made this on Tuesday night, so that Wednesday evening I&#8217;d have a simple meal ready to go. I loved this crust, and mind you I did not follow the recipe perfectly, nor did I have the peel nor the stone. I just used a square small baking sheet, oiled it up, topped it and baked it. The crust was nicely crisped, with lovely coloring and such a nice flavor. I&#8217;ve made a lot of pizza dough recipes, but this one worked great with the limitations I had. AND THANK YOU for posting grams. I much prefer to make dough by weight instead of volume. \nAlso can I just mention how much I love pizza for using up the scraps? I had a cup of homemade spaghetti sauce left, which turned into pizza sauce. Some leftover shredded chicken, from the stock I had made for chicken noodle soup. And some languishing spinach in my fridge. One pizza was turned into bbq chicken + pineapple pizza. The other was spinach and anchovy.",
				"1/4 tsp of instant yeast? Seems very low. No sugar?",
				"..FLOUR&#8230;LOL?",
				"&#8230; have you ever used active sourdough starter in this pizza dough and can I use bread flower I also have double zero from Italy that&#8217;s actually made for pizza have a great night..!!?????"

				"Thank-you for this insight into your cultured cheese making experience.  I\u2019ve been a vegan for a long time (30yrs) and love the Nush cream cheese; it would be great to be able to cultivate my own  it\u2019s not quite the same without that cheesy funky bit.",
				"What is measurements for adding probiotic? ( my first time .. )",
				"Made this recipe with a spoon full of another vegan cream cheese i bought, and it worked perfectly!\nLoved it and so did my friends!!!",
				"Super helpful! Thank you so much for the reply. I&#8217;d planned on following your exact method for my first try, and will use a pyrex bowl with lid. I&#8217;ll be winging it on how much probiotic capsule to add, as my current supply is 50 billion per capsule. I&#8217;m thinking 1/3 as much as listed in the recipe, but am wondering if there&#8217;s any concern with adding too much probiotic?",
				"I&#8217;ll definitely be trying this soon! When I&#8217;ve made other cultured foods, typically the instructions have been to cover the container with a cheesecloth (or similar, permeable cloth material) rather than the container lid or plastic, as you&#8217;ve recommend. I&#8217;ve always thought air needed to be let in (while still keeping bugs out)&#8230;what do you think? It seems you&#8217;ve had success with the method you&#8217;ve described, so I&#8217;m curious.\nThanks!",
				"OK, thanks! I imagine we will eat it in record time. After I posted that question I remembered that I have frozen pieces of raw cashew cheezecake and it&#8217;s fine when thawed, so maybe this would be similar. Can&#8217;t wait to try your recipe!",
				"Have you tried freezing it? Thanks!",
				"I&#8217;m going to try this after Thanksgiving.  How long does the cheese last refrigerated and can you freeze it?  Would also like to use a nut lower in carbs than cashew.  Have you tried cultured cheeses with walnuts, pecans, or macadamia&#8217;s?\nThank you",
				"I made the cheese and it turned out perfect. I let it sit 2 days. I stirred it twice a day and sprinkled the salt on top. It didnt need that final 1/2 teaspoon. I was pretty liberal with the salt. I added the nutritional yeast and it rounded out the flavor nicely. Im going to take part of it and add some herbs and maybe garlic to create a variation. I used the probiotic you suggested. Your link has a newer version with a prebiotic so I went to whole foods and they had some of the original without the prebiotic. It had a clearance sticker on the shelf, so I guess the company is discontinuing it. Thank you for your recipe, its helping to keep me vegan. Not eating dairy cheese has been hard until now.",
				"Hi Eva,\nI recently tried cashew cheese, and I LOVE IT! Your recipe looks yummy. From the pictures, it looks like you are using raw cashews. For clarification&#8230;Do I use raw cashews?",
				"So, the affiliate link you have for the probiotic has FOS, which is fructooligosaccharide, which is a prebiotic. ? Is that the one you actually use?  \nHave you ever vacuum-sealed the cheese? I\u2019m wondering how long that would extend the shelf-life. I love Miyoko\u2019s vegan cheese, but it\u2019s so expensive and we used to have a great variety of flavors, but my local natural food store has cut way back. It would be fun to try my own and make a few wheels in different flavors. I\u2019m also going to try doing it with almonds because I\u2019ve just found out my son is allergic to cashews.",
				"Thanks Eva! No problem at all on the delay. I was waiting for the heat wave we\u2019d been having to end anyway because every time I try to make something fermented or cultured in this weather it gets a little too funky a little too fast! ?\nI like the advice to do 2/3 of the recipe. Will attempt later this week if the weather forecast isn\u2019t lying and let you know how it goes!",
				"Hey Eva,\nFinally got my hands on some vegan probiotic capsules (hard to find up here in Canada for some reason!) and keen to try making this cheese!\nPossibly a dumb question, but can I halve this recipe? (I have a Vitamix with a regular size blender jar\u2014seriously considering investing in the 32 oz one!).\nthanks!",
				"Hi Eva,\nthank you for your hard work! I really appreciate all the detailed information and the recipes (different flavours)\nKeep up the good work"

				"I just wanted to come and say that I\u2019ve made this recipe probably 10+ times since I discovered it early last year, and it\u2019s basically my favourite meal to make! If I make a batch of this ricotta I\u2019ll happily eat it every night until it\u2019s gone. This recipe has improved my life by at least 500% and I would just like to thank you for that",
				"Made this recipe and it was very good.  I did add a bit more salt and basil to the ricotta as the taste was not pronounced enough and also a squeeze of lemon juice which gave it even more freshness.  Overall, great recipe and will make it again.",
				"Hi, since the pea ricotta makes double what is needed for the recipe, can it be frozen to use another time? Thank you. MJ",
				"This was really tasty and a huge success, even in my omnivorous, cheese-loving, household! Even the child who despises peas went for a second helping.\nAs a variation, I&#8217;ve played with the ricotta recipe by soaking the cashews for a few hours (makes it creamier if you have the extra time) and added 2 tsp each of lemon juice and lemon zest for a bit more acidity to offset the spicy noodles. So good!",
				"This is one of my family\u2019s all time favorites! Simple, easy and unbelievably delicious! Thank you so much for sharing.",

The broth was so flavorful and satisfying!  And I\u2019m happy to have leftover broth for making more yummy ramen tomorrow!",

The first time I made it, 8 cups of water worked well but since then it\u2019s way too much.\n    We are in the middle of our monsoon season (we\u2019re high desert the rest of the time\u2014VERY dry).  It\u2019s raining 2-3 times as much as any monsoon season I can remember.  Everything\u2019s completely soaked!  I share this because it might explain why some of us need 8 cups of water and others need less.  My experience:  Pre-monsoon;  8 cups\u2026now(major league monsoon); 6 cups is almost too much.\n   Thanks again for a delightful recipe.",

				"What a great recipe!  I used the 8 cups in a La Cruiset style pot.  It seemed like too much water but after cooking, the lentils thickened and I ended up with a fairly thick dal.  This is the first tadka I\u2019ve ever made but It certainly won\u2019t be the last.  Both my husband and I really liked how the flavor of the spices was more \u201cavailable\u201d than with a \u201cregular\u201d dal using similar ingredients.",

Always a hit! \ud83d\ude00\np.s. I&#8217;ll try adding a bay leaf next time.",

The seeds do not contain casaicin, the hot ingredient of chillies, and removing them or leaving them will not affect the heat. The active ingredient comes from the pith and ribs of the chili.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if the thing you are measuring is dry or wet. A cup is a cup. If you need a cup of water fill to 8 oz mark if you need. Cup of flour or lentils or whatever fill to the 8 oz mark! It\u2019s seriously that simple. DON\u2019T bother with trying to figure out the weight etc. I used to use an 8 oz mug and just scoop stuff with that until o got \u201creal\u201d measuring cups.

I added salt and turmeric during the simmer, and also drained the lentils a little after cooking as I like it thicker and a bit more concentrated flavour-wise. I also opted for half a TBSP of curry powder and half a TBSP of garam masala rather than a flat out TBSP of curry powder. Also, a garnish of toasted cumin seeds, nigella/onion seeds and crispy fried onion.",

It&#8217;s so easy to follow, I just sit down and check what I need to do next.\nSo, please, for the comment, bear in mind that Russian, we&#8217;re a really direct people.\nThe way I had to clean the lentil was insane. I had to rinse half a kilo (again, I&#8217;m Russian, if you want to conquer European market, it has to be in grams and Celsius, we google all that memorize it in the end, but it&#8217;s annoying and we go straight to the Jamie Oliver&#8217;s site instead) of rice and lentils to get it clear in a small sieve. Jesus, the patience it takes. Thank god I was drinking wine.\nThe tendency of the European market is the same as the US healthy one: the extreme opposite of fast food and the usual potato/meat cuisine (depends on the country though). The Czech one where I lived for 6 years has the most vegan and raw food one (!) in European.\nI added a bit of smoked paprika, smoked salt and za&#8217;atar, turned out to be real f*cking nice.\nBest of luck to you getting subscribers, you&#8217;re worth it.

Any kind of green is a great addition.",

Highly suggest for anyone looking for a wonderful flavourful soup!!!",
				"I made this at high altitude. 5280 feet.\nGood flavor even thought I was out of cumin.  I used a mild chili so all could enjoy.  I drained water from lentils early  because I worried they were going to overcook but then I realized they weren\u2019t thick like the photo and I probably should have cooked more before dumping the water. In the end I added back in about 3 cups of water and assume it will soak up overnight.  The flavor was good and texture fine but will be better tomorrow probably.",

I tried another dal recipe tonight using 4 cups of liquid and 1 1/2 cups red lentils but it was much too thin for my liking. Wondering if maybe I cooked it wrong but figured when I try again it might be better to start with less liquid and add more as needed. Thank you for your help!",

I used jalapenos, Rani hot curry powder, and a bit less water and it&#8217;s the perfect flavor. First time I&#8217;ve ever cooked dal and I can safely say I don&#8217;t need to try any other recipes!",
				"This was definitely too much water and not enough flavor. I think 5 or 6 cups of water would&#8217;ve been sufficient. I had to add the rest of my lentils in (maybe another cup or 2) and 2 potatoes to thicken it. I stopped measuring spices and just started adding to taste. The measured amount were hardly noticeable when added to the lentils with its extra water. I nearly added another can of diced tomatoes but opted against it\u2014I think either way would&#8217;ve been fine. Don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll be using this recipe again.",
				"I\u2019ve had trouble finding red lentils anywhere because of the pandemic. Would green lentils work fine for this recipe? What would I have to tweak?",
				"Amazing recipe!  Followed the ingredients and recipe except I drained the lentils because I wanted a thicker dal.  My family loved it!",
				"I used 1:2 ratio lentils to water. I added my 1/4tsp of salt to lentil water instead of the food when cooking it\u2019s more bang for the buck salt wise and I don\u2019t like to use a lot of salt. Added  1 bay leaf to water and a slice of onion.. this helps the lentil have a flavor before adding to onion mix because lentils are flavor sucker uppers.. so it is always better to give salt and mild flavor to lentil in their own pot..",
				"I can&#8217;t understand why you would be disappointed if you made it correctly, but using a little common sense works wonders.  Cooking involves &#8216;tasting&#8217; every so often and should always be an adventure.  It sounds like you are beginning to branch out of your comfort zone, because if you were an experienced cook, you would have known to tweak it.\n     If you ARE a beginner, then count this as a learning process and figure out what went wrong.

				"This is my go to dahl recipe! I use half the amount of lentils and 3 1/2 cups water, also adding turmeric and garam masala. I use more than half of the spices (although under half tbsp curry powder due to added spices) as I enjoy the stronger flavour. I also blend some of the onion/spice/tomato mixture for a smoother dahl. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Hi Eva. I have been looking for a tasty dhal recipe for a while. What better place to start than from a namesake. I will let you know how I get on.",
				"I, too, was worried about the amount of water listed. I did cook the lentils in the full 8 cups listed but then I drained most of it &#8211; probably 6 cups &#8211; off. I like a thicker dal  and figured I could add it back in slowly if I needed to. This worked perfectly for me and the flavors only get better as it sits. Thanks !",
				"Great recipe thanks!  My first time making Dal.  I could only find green lentils and they didn&#8217;t cook down much so I blended half of them for a more soup texture.  The tadka was so good and aromatic I almost hated to add anything to it.  I will definitely be making this again and look forward to making it with red lentils next time.",
				"Winter in Cape Town pairs perfectly with this delicious authentic Dal!! So glad I found your recipe. Had all the ingredients and followed your method to the T! Thanks for sharing ?",
				"May I know how long can you keep the cooked dal in the fridge? Thanks!",
				"You know, I loved the commentary as I am a learner in the field of Dal. I super appreciated the whys and wherefores. I failed last night with yellow split peas which were still crunchy after 3 hours of cooking so was looking for a red lentil recipe.

That sauce would be amazing in so many dishes or even as a soup. Hahaha\nThank you!",
				"Turned out great! I had cooked farro on hand so i used that as the grain. Didn\u2019t need to use the breadcrumbs but did need a tad more olive oil to give the mix more moisture.

It didn&#8217;t happen to me &#8211; the balls were quite solid and I even left one of them still soaking in the sauce in the fridge for the night (just to test) and it was pretty solid in the morning. What might have helped in my case is that I intentionally overcooked rice and made it just a tiny bit slushy and so the rice helped chickpeas to bind well. Try it.\nThe sauce was great too! I added some turmeric for the color because my peppers were rather white.\nThe most important thing is that my meat loving husband loved the chickpeas balls! I always warn him when I make something vegan and ask him to tell the truth if he doesn&#8217;t like it.  I warned him this time too but he really loved them and even asked for the leftovers to be packed for lunch. It was quite unfortunate because I was going to finish them myself the next day lol.",

I would also caution anyone using a food processor about how dense this mix gets.  Not all food processors can handle it.  I almost feel as though it might be best to do the nuts separately from the chickpeas and mix them together later on.",

It seems a waste to add the nuts right at the beginning when they would add some noce texture if you added them with the last few chickpeas.\nThe sauce however was even worse. Way too much coconut milk which overpowered everything. \nI wont be making these again",

I made the sauce in the food processor. I thought I would save a step and take out one less piece of equipment. The texture would be better if made in the blender as suggested. .  Well done!!!

				"Delicious!  I&#8217;ve been looking forward to making this for a day or two, and the flavor was just what I was hoping for.  My meatballs didn&#8217;t end up holding their form once I put them in the sauce.  Should I have baked them longer or could it be because I didn&#8217;t cool the meatballs before putting them in the sauce?",

I opened the foil to let it cool, then walked away for about 10 minutes, and when I came back the loaf had deflated into a wrinkly mound.

This is a lot cheaper, plus it was a fun way to spend my lunch break during COVID-19 quarantine.\nI can verify Shannon&#8217;s account that 35 min in the Instant Pot (plus the oven bake as written) works out great. It just barely fit in my 6 qt. cooker. Put the loaf on top of the steamer rack and don&#8217;t forget to add at least 2 cups water to the bottom!",
				"We made this as written, using a combination of roasted garlic and seasoned vegetable Better Than Bouillon to make the broth. I really like the idea of wrapping the loaf to keep it dense. We put it in the Trager to bake, opening the foil to smoke it about five minutes at the end. We made sandwiches with it, and thought the taste was reminiscent of meatloaf. It made wonderful sandwiches! We have tried different vegan sliced sandwich &#8220;meat&#8221; and found then to be inedible, so we are thrilled to have something we really like! We are looking forward to experimenting with the seasonings, and thank you for sharing this!",

It is a bit of waiting around for it to cook and cool, but the actual hands-on time was pretty minimal.\nI think next time, I may try some different flavor add-ins. I like the idea of some liquid smoke, and something sweet on the outside to make it ham-like.

Definitely going to share this recipe with others.",

Oh my, this is truly a delicious cookie.  I will definitely make them again.  I may add the cornstarch only because there is an oily residue left  on my hand when eating the warm cookie.  Will try to send photos the cookies are picture perfect.\nThank you!",

				"I wish I had paid Emily Su&#8217;s review more attention, because I do agree largely with what she said. While it did gel up almost perfectly (the alcoholic ones, anyway; I also made some virgin versions and they did not gel nearly as well), there was something very off about the texture of the ginger cream layer. Maybe it would have been better if I had substituted the nut milk like suggested.\nAnd while you could most definitely taste the jalepeno, you could barely taste the mango, though to be fair, I used a mango cocktail juice as I couldn&#8217;t find just plain mango juice. I considered mango nectar but chose the cocktail juice instead mostly because it was cheaper, so maybe it would have tasted better with the mango nectar. I dunno.\nNobody including myself really wanted to try more than one, and I made a LOT, so I&#8217;d say it was a pretty big failure. Im afraid that none of my friends will try any other vegan jello shots I make in the future.",

				"@Eva Agha, You emailed me the recipe a year ago, thank you for that and I see that it&#8217;s visible again on the website, too.  I finally got around to making it today and wow, I wish I had made it earlier!  I&#8217;ve made the buffalo tofu a few times for salads, and it is soo so good, but this is the first time trying the mac n cheese. I didn&#8217;t like the first couple of bites, maybe because I was expecting a cheese flavor and nothing but cheese tastes like cheese, lol (I&#8217;m not vegan, can you tell?), but once we changed the name to mac n sauce and just appreciated it for what it was, we realized it was incredibly delicious.  I went back for seconds!  I often crave mac n cheese, but dairy doesn&#8217;t sit well in my body, but this made me feel great!  And so quick and easy to make!  It is going into my recipe book for sure!  I love that it is a healthy plus animal friendly comfort food!  Yum!  Thanks!  Going to browse all your other recipes now for more gem, hehee!",
				"This was so good, wholefamily loved it!",
				"Made this tonight!! Wonderful. Thank you for the recipe",
				"This is so delicious and easy! I love the the ingredients for the Mac n cheese sauce are non perishable and can whip up in just a few minutes!  Thank you so much for sharing! Can\u2019t wait to enjoy this again!",

I&#8217;ll be using this breading/baking method in other recipes too, it&#8217;s so good. And the mac &amp; cheese is the first vegan one I&#8217;ve made that I&#8217;ll actually make again, just as others have said. The texture is perfect, and although I don&#8217;t love that I can taste some coconut, that is easily masked with a little extra buffalo sauce ? Do you think I could skip the coconut milk next time and sub more plant milk instead, or does it need the coconut milk to thicken? Thanks for the great recipe! Shared with some vegan Facebook groups ?",
				"The buffalo part of this recipe is amazing. 100% will make that again. The cheeze sauce, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t our taste. The texture was slimy, not creamy. Sadly we had a few bites and had to toss it.  I have had much better success with cashew based cheeze sauces. Cheers.",
				"Can this be made in advance and reheated?",
				"Okay I am a meat-eater but I did used to be vegetarian. I had tried several mac n &#8220;cheese&#8221; recipes with pumpkin and/or cashew and the like but was never a fan. Now I still entertain some vegan friends and decided to give this one a go. Well let me tell you, I&#8217;ve never even made a from-scratch real mac n cheese recipe that I&#8217;ve liked as much as this one! I am not a huge smoke fan so I did use only one teaspoon of smoked paprika but this was so silky, creamy, and flavorful. It is a perfect accomplice to a backyard BBQ. The tofu was superb too. All in all, a huge hit with everyone! My only complaint is when I added the tapioca starch it thickened almost instantly and I had to whisk very fast and add water due to clumps. End result was still fantastic though! I only had about 10 oz of pasta but added all of the sauce to it anyways. There wasn&#8217;t a drop left.",
				"This recipe is fantastic!  Best vegan cheese sauce I&#8217;ve ever made and the tofu was crispy and delicious and perfect! Will definitely be making again soon!",

				"Dude.  This whole recipe is delicious, but you just made my day with this cheese sauce!  I&#8217;ve tried what feels like a billion (but is probably only about a dozen) recipes for cheese sauce, and this was the first one where I was like, Eureka!  We&#8217;ve got it!!  *so good*!!!  It&#8217;s the closest to a real mac and cheese sauce that I&#8217;ve come across in the vegan world, and I could just hug you.   \ud83d\ude42",
				"Mmmmm this was so, so good! I  would not have thought that mac and cheese could taste like this with coconut milk, wow.  I followed pretty much exactly but we were low on plant milk so I just filled the empty coconut milk can with some of the pasta cooking water and splashed that in instead. Worked great. Delicious with loads of freshly ground black pepper. We also loved sprinkling the top with the little bits of spicy Panko that were left at the bottom of the bowl after tossing the tofu wings in the hot sauce. Thank you!",
				"I tried only the coconut milk mac &amp; cheese part of this recipe last night, just to test it out.  It was absolutely fantastic!  My teenage boys took second helpings,which, of course, is the true measure of success!  I have tried nut based mac &amp; cheese recipes that I thought were okay, but none of them really &#8220;wowed&#8221; me &#8211; yours totally does!  I will definitely make the entire recipe next time but now I know that your recipe is absolutely going to be my &#8220;go to&#8221; recipe for macaroni and cheese!  Thank you!",
				"This looks om nom nom amazing, thank you for  sharing. I&#8217;m happy that you chose to use tofu for the wings rather than cauliflower.",
				"This recipe looks amazing! The creamy mac and cheese with the crunchy tofu wings plus that hit of spice&#8230;. I can&#8217;t wait to make (and EAT) this!",

				"Hi Eva!\nI had a great time making this recipe. The mo mom\u2019s  were firm and light and so lovely &#8211; I ended up potsticker-ing them because I didn\u2019t want to drag out the steamer from the bottom far-back cabinets. \ud83d\ude42 The chutney is PERFECT.  I won\u2019t tell you how many were consumed in one go between the hubs and myself! Brava! So darn delicious!!",

				"Hi,\nYour recipe looks so delicious and I really want to try. But, I would like to first start with store bought wrappers. I have no idea where to buy them from or what they are called.\nCan you give me more info on store bought wrappers please? Thank you in advance!!",
				"Hi, I love seeing this recipe, and will be trying it out shortly. One thing I was wondering about: Do you know if it might be possible to make a dough with chickpea flour as the base instead of wheat flour?",

I have recently made potstickers from scratch (just the filling, not the dough) and am now seeking more recipes for vegan/vegetarian fillings. \nQuestion: I know potstickers can be frozen after assembly and you just cook them from frozen without defrosting them. Can your momos and dumplings be frozen? I know tofu changes its texture when it&#8217;s frozen (I&#8217;ve deliberately done that by just freezing tofu in the package, defrosting, and then squeezing out tons of water) but I didn&#8217;t know if the tofu in the momos or dumplings would make the dumplings extra watery on the inside when cooking them after being frozen? Does my question and what I&#8217;m rambling about make sense? I hope so!",
				"Looks yummy! Am I correct in assuming that this filling could be used for potstickers (gyoza wrappers) rather than momos?",
				"Made these last night, we were really impressed with how strong and amazing the flavors were! Great recipe \ud83d\ude42",

It was SO good and reminded me of when I used to get dairy fondues out at nice restaurants. I will definitely be making it again and again. Thank you so much!! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hey Eva-first of all, I love your recipes and am so grateful for them. I\u2019ve spent some time in India as my partner is from Delhi, so to be able to find better-than-restaurant indian food that is also vegan is incredible (especially because his family doesn\u2019t believe indian food can be made without ghee or other animal products, as you probably suspect). So thank you. It\u2019s so inspiring to the two of us as vegans.\nOn to my question, which might be a bit silly: how do I know if the cheese is culturing? Will it taste very different, or just a little different? I\u2019ve been culturing it in LA here for about 27 hours with the windows open about half the time (temps in the 70s &amp; 80s) and don\u2019t notice a big difference in taste, if any at all. It\u2019s definitely yummy, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s culturing.\nAny help is appreciated because I\u2019ll definitely be culturing lots of vegan cheeses from now on. \ud83d\ude42",

				"Hi Eva\nIt&#8217;s Susana from Canada. I just adore all of your recipes; I look forward to each and every one of them with anticipation.\nI am so excited to try this fondue!! It is so authentic with the creative way of making it a &#8220;cultured cheese&#8221;. I like this version so much more than the other versions; I can see the flavor profile being so good with all the additional ingredients.\nI had one question:  can I substitute something for the alcohol? I.e. adding a little broth plus something a little acidic (i.e. a vinegar?)\nI love that you have so many &#8220;cheese&#8221; recipes on the blog, which are creative. The quejo fresco is amazing.\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make more cultured cheeses!  That is one of my passions is to make dairy free substitutes (as close as possible to the real thing)\nThank you for all of the amazing hard work you do, in the very detailed steps that you give us so that our recipes are successful.\nThank you for giving us recipes that are more detailed  (which are not boring!), which I love (i.e. bread making, cake building, papusas, Indian food). I could go on and on, I love all the recipes that you put out\nThank you for your kindness\nSusana"

Topped with a dark chocolate ganache and roasted hazelnut meal, this cake was a dream: super moist, hazelnutty and all around delicious!\nFirst, thanks for publishing weights for your recipes. It makes scaling up and down super easy. Secondly, thanks for this wonderful recipe itself!",

I was very confident it would be awesome, because I made your vanille layer cake a while back and it was amazing as well.\nI filled it with a chocolate mousse and used a hazelnut buttercream as a topping. All vegan of course. I made two 8&#8243; cakes. Next time I will cut off the domes as the cake layers were a bit too high.\nThanks for another great recipe!",

				"Thank you for the tip! Following your advice, I ended up replacing the coconut milk with about 200g of Ripple half and half, which is the thickest plant based creamer I can find out there that has a fairly neutral taste. I think it worked out quite nicely! I let it sit in the fridge for about 5 hours before whipping it, so it was a tad runny half way through frosting the cake. I think it probably would be fine if I let it set in the fridge overnight. Overall, I think the ganache turned out really well! This recipe is most definitely a keeper! Thank you again!",
				"Can coconut milk be substituted? I&#8217;m concerned that the frosting will taste a little too coconuty. By the way your cake recipe is AMAZING!!!!!!! I tried your vanilla cake recipe and this is literally THE best vegan cake recipe period. I can&#8217;t wait to try the chocolate cake one!",

The yellow cake is delicious and the ganache is sooo rich and yummy! I put the ganache in the freezer for about 45 minutes because I\u2019m just that impatient and  luckily it was not runny when I applied it to the cake. Amazing recipe thank you so much for sharing!",

I had to blind bake it at 400 for 20 minutes instead of 350 for an hour. It still turned out really delicious! I used Miyoko&#8217;s salted stick butter. This will be my go to quiche dough recipe from now on but next time I&#8217;ll do it just like you said!",

I made an apple pie with a lattice crust.\n I&#8217;ve never seen so many layers!!   Incredibly flakey and delicious!

I was surprised my local Co op had the black gram. We live in a very small and remote area. I was super happy we found it. I made mine in a insta pot and used dried kidney beans, also cooked in the insta. Also I used homemade gram masala,  and Ancho chilies, we don&#8217;t care for a ton of heat.

We recently moved and I could only find my ground spices and not my whole ones. \nI added the ground spices after the onions, garlic and fresh ground ginger;  the fragrance was heavenly.

I skipped the chiles (I was making it for my kids) and kasoori methi (I didn&#8217;t have it on hand). The flavor is excellent and this was not difficult to make. I have made dahl makni before and used so much butter (I am not vegan). This version was better. I will definitely make this again.",

				"This is a fantastic recipe, I loved it as did my whole family.Thank you and keep them coming, you are an inspiration.",
				"I used diced fire roasted tomatoes&#8230;.maybe not what was meant. It&#8217;s a bit watery. I&#8217;ll continue to simmer.",
				"My first time on this site, my first recipe and I give it FIVE stars!  This recipe is addictive \ud83d\ude42\nI used green small lentils and for a chili, I used a Jalapeno chopped up and took out perhaps about 70% of the seeds. It ended up perfectly spicy. I used the 1 cup of tomato paste the recipe called for but was skeptic to that amount. After simmering for 5 minutes with spices it was still VERY much tomato flavor only.\nBut&#8230; no need to fear. After finishing the recipe there is a complex flavor of spices, almost hard to separate the flavors in the stew, with a creaminess indeed. The flavor is addictive and I will definitely make this recipe many many times again!\nThank you! I am very impressed with how you create such a depth in this dish. I can&#8217;t wait to try more of your recipes!!!",

I am so loving your recipes &#8211; they are amazing &#8211; flavoursome, easy and inexpensive to make and they are full of fabulous, easy to find, mouthwatering ingredients.  The urad dahl  is soaking at the moment and mid afternoon I&#8217;ll be getting started on making this dish for the first time.  One of the many great things about living by myself is that these recipes provide enough food for several meals and I can freeze at least half so I am never short of something nutritious for dinner when I don&#8217;t feel like cooking a full meal from scratch."

				"This was absolutely delicious.  We added kalamata olives and red bell peppers to cut the richness a bit. I want to thank you so much for teaching me that I can make pizza crust.  Even went all out and bought a stone and peel! I did adjust that a bit &#8211; 1.5 cups whole wheat, 1.5 cups all purpose, and 1 cup spelt.  Turned out great but made enough for about 2 pizzas. Thank you so much!",
				"Could this be made with Lavish Flatbread instead of pizza dough?  I was thinking about trying that and just wondering if anyone has tried that before?",
				"This pizza is amazing!  I will definitely be making this again soon (especially since my non-vegan family preferred this to their own).  You know it\u2019s delicious when a 5 year old asks for seconds and thirds!",

				"Quick question, how much of the garlic sauce do you more or less put on the pizza? Thanks!",
				"Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious! We made one by following the recipe exactly and the other we subbed zucchini for mushrooms for the kids and they loved it!",
				"Super yummy! I skipped the vegan mozzarella but added sliced  mini heirloom tomatoes and drizzled with white truffle oil and sea salt.",
				"This recipe was incredible! The garlic white sauce is absolutely delicious and paired with the carmelization on the mushrooms was just so divine. My friends were raving, can&#8217;t wait to try more of your recipes!",

				"Great recipe! What vegan mozzarella do you use??",
				"Yessss all of my favourite things! Mushrooms, creamy sauce and cheese! Also keep caramelising everything at the moment! Can\u2019t wait to make this! Xo"

I had everything on hand, except for the miso, so I just added a little extra low sodium soy sauce. Such flavor depth. Thanks so much!",

				"I recently went vegan. I&#8217;ve always felt strongly about the animal industry and sourced my food really clean, but due to health reasons have had to change how I eat. I made a family recipe for bolognese that was very similar to this, except of course that it was traditional. This has all the flavor and joy of my family recipe, without the unhealthy aspects. Thank you! I love it!",
				"Amazing recipe! My favorite lentil bolognaise so far!",
				"Fantastic. A absolutel favourite!!",
				"I made this recipe on a Sunday afternoon, and we enjoyed the fragrant smells from the kitchen almost as much as the delicious taste of the bolognese sauce on whole wheat pasta! I used dried herbs because that&#8217;s what I had on hand, and it still packed a lot of flavor with shaved vegan parmesan cheese and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper. Fortunately, the recipe makes a generous amount of sauce, so we have plenty to enjoy again tomorrow."

Honestly, it rivals any non-vegan cake by far. Even my carnivore Dad ate two slices and wanted some to take home. I followed your recipe for two 6-inch cakes and they came out perfectly and so moist! Your instructions and video were clear and easy to follow. \nThank you again!!",

My oven takes 40min (!!) for 2x 6inch cakes to come out perfect which is a lot longer baking time. But ovens can be so so variable. The one time I pulled them out going by the time (my first bake) they collapsed as they weren\u2019t cooked enough.",
				"So my first cake flopped for some reason but I figured out that it just needed longer in my particular oven. Since then (a year ago) this has baked to perfection every time and become a family staple and everyone that has tasted it has been amazed it\u2019s vegan. I make it for\nSo many different occasions  and it\u2019s become my number one recipe! Thank you so much!!",

				"Hi Eva, this cake looks beautiful. I am gonna make it next week as a big wedding cake for a friend, and was wondering if I could make all the mix at one time and leave a part of it aside while each part is in the oven, or is it better to make each layer mix apart so that it wont affect the texture?",
				"Hello! I have just made this cake but the cakes are so flat. I don&#8217;t know how to fix this issue. This was a practice cake, so I can try again (making a cake for my son&#8217;s first birthday). I did use 9 inch pans. So maybe I needed to bake the cakes for longer. I&#8217;m really not sure how to make them rise.",

I always try to keep my baked goods out of the fridge for as long as it&#8217;s safe, to preserve texture.",
				"This is a delicious cake! I needed an egg free, but not fully vegan cake so I used whole cow&#8217;s milk and substituted half the oil for melted butter for flavour &#8211; it turned out AMAZING with a beautiful texture and very moist! You would never suspect there were no eggs. This is by far the best vegan vanilla cake I&#8217;ve found!",

I would like to make a larger wedding cake with an 8\u201d and 10\u201d layer.\nPlease can you recommend how much you would multiple the recipe for a 10\u201d size and have you tried it?

I feel that the finished cake is maybe just a touch dense/too moist, but it truly is great all the same. I live at a high altitude (Denver) and am curious if that may have thrown off the end product. What would you adjust for high altitude cooking? I am definitely planning to make this again.",

They&#8217;re &#8220;done&#8221;, but they turned out really claggy and wet. I&#8217;m going to try again tomorrow!",

I made this cake into a 3-layer, 2-tiered birthday cake and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of 1/2 cup chopped chocolate to make it sort-of-chocolate chip-like.  I used light olive oil. It is so good that we ate the trial cake without any frosting!  The final cake had alternating buttercream and ganache.",

I\u2019ve been practicing making this cake every weekend this month (leading up to my sons first birthday) and though it tastes delicious my cakes are coming out super dense and moist (not horrible but hard to cut). I\u2019m measuring everything by weight. I am using a 1-1 gluten free flour, could that be causing it or am I missing something?\nThanks!!",
				"Cakes came out great and refrigerated overnight after wrapping in plastic wrap. Took out next day to decorate and when I had to put the second layer on it was sticky and so difficult to to without it sticking to my cake lifter. Did I do something wrong?",
				"OMG I used white vinegar in one layer I made by mistake then realized it. I used apple cider for the second layer. My question is will this make the taste very noticable?",
				"I\u2019m planning to make this cake for a vegan friend. Can I use a Bundt cake, or is it going to be too sticky?",

				"Hi Eva, thank you for this delicious recipe! I modified the recipe a bit using half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour, and decreased the sugar a bit. Divided between an 8&#8243; and a 6&#8243; square pan. They baked beautifully, were done in about 25-30 minutes. I used fresh strawberry puree between layers, and a vegan buttercream icing. And it was shaped into a firetruck, for our son&#8217;s second birthday! He loved it \ud83d\ude42",
				"I&#8217;m experienced in making vegan/eggless cupcakes, but have only dabbled in eggless layer cakes. A friend asked me to make a birthday cake for her egg-allergic son, so I tested several recipes and this was by far the best. The texture was moist and tender, not gummy as some eggless cakes can be. The cake wasn&#8217;t overly sweet, with a delicious aroma. I used cow&#8217;s milk instead of plant-based, since full vegan was not a requirement, and the cake turned out fantastic. I will definitely use again!",

I&#8217;m not vegan or even vegetarian,  but I am always on the hunt for healthier versions or things. I would gladly choose this dip over any other. No matter your diet (or lack of diet), I highly recommend this dip. You could easily trick somebody into thinking this thing is 1000 calories per fork full.",

				"So good. I tried for 2 weeks to get chives at several places but they weren\u2019t available anywhere so I ended up using dried. Also didn\u2019t have the thyme or oregano, so I ended up subbing some other spices. I\u2019m sure it would have been super amazing with the correct spices. I\u2019m rating it now with a bit of baguette, and don\u2019t feel like that paired well. I have a lot left so I\u2019ll try with some other stuff.

				"I have to tell you, I\u2019ve been trying to find a pan pizza dough recipe that tastes like Pizza Hut for many years now. You NAILED it! And it\u2019s so simple!!! I added a drizzle of maple syrup in the beginning and it was perfect, super crunchy crust but really thick and bready. I used the vegan liquid mozzarella so I had to drop the temp to 525 so it wouldn\u2019t burn but it was still perfect. Best pizza I\u2019ve had since going vegan. The pizza gods and my tummy thank you so much for this!",
				"Wow this is the ultimate homemade pizza recipe! Will definitely be making it for a Friday treat sometime soon \ud83d\ude42",

				"This is such a good recipe!!! Thank you so much! I love baking and despite being vegan for 5 years now, at the beginning I didn&#8217;t know how to bake vegan, so I just baked for the others and felt bad for the animals, because its a bit ironic for me being vegan but then serving others animal products. The first time I made it was for my workplace and everyone loved it (it looked great, too!). Then I made it a few of times for family, etc. And everyone absolutely loved it. Most people doubt that a vegan cake can taste good before they taste it but once they do, they cannot stop eating it. Thank you so much!",
				"Thanks for the amazing recipe! I did it without the strawberries (as per your easy vanilla cake) and I found it perfect as buttercream to cover a 3 layer cake. It was very soft at the beginning, but after some minutes in the fridge it was perfect to frost and cover the cake. However, I put it overnight in the fridge and its consistency got too hard (even after having left it long out of the fridge before tasting it). I will definitely keep it as a buttercream recipe, but do you have any other suggestion for a softer frosting that would work OK for a 3 layer cake? I need to prepare my sister&#8217;s wedding cake and I&#8217;ve been trying several recipes but with no success. She would like a vegan 2 tier cake (3 layer each tier).",
				"To be honest, I had the same frosting journey and I hear you 100%! Can&#8217;t wait to try this recipe today, thank you for all the love and care you put into your postings!",
				"(it&#8217;s worth noting as well, that I am following the suggestion from your vegan vanilla cake recipe to omit the strawberry sauce)",
				"Hi, I just made this recipe on a trial run for using it to make a birthday cake for my vegan friend. The general consensus among the people who tried it is that its very greasy, and sort of just tastes like crisco, and it was very runny. I wanted to confirm I understood the recipe, it calls for 24oz fat total: 16oz vegan shortening (crisco in my case) and 8oz vegan butter (sunflower butter in my case). Have you run into either of those issues, and do you have any recommendations for fixing them if you have? Thanks so much! Even with the issues I had with the frosting the cake as a whole was a big hit",
				"Can you freeze this recipe? And then thaw and ice the cake at a later time?",
				"I&#8217;m no genius baker; I make everything by following recipes. I&#8217;ve had success with making baked goods, but  this is the best cake I have ever made, and the easiest. I couldn&#8217;t find chocolate extract locally nor could I procure it online in time (the linked chocolate extract in the recipe is no longer available), but I was able to get Droste cocoa and the cake was fabulously, exotically chocolatey. This recipe yielded enough batter for two 6&#8243; layers. I lacked the bandwidth and thermometer for the Italian meringue, so I made American strawberry vegan buttercream frosting and decorated with sliced strawberries and chopped walnuts. Fellow amateurs, be not afraid. You got this. Divine.",
				"I was impressed with this recipe because even though it was a bit complicated, it turned out perfectly the first time and I\u2019m a novice baker. It\u2019s very helpful to have each step laid out so explicitly. Without the strawberry, I have to say the frosting is quite bland. But a gorgeous texture. I used freeze dried strawberries instead of pur\u00e9e and it was delicious. Everyone was impressed how creamy it was. I definitely recommend adding salt if your aquafaba is unsalted.",
				"Hi, We made the meringue buttercream, but cut the recipe down to a fourth, which meant we only used 6oz of shortening.  Everything went well, and the texture is gorgeous, but it tastes like shortening.  It&#8217;s a little sweet and strawberryish, but the  overwhelming taste is shortening?  Any ideas what we did wrong?  Thank you!",
				"Hi,\nI made this will Cisco shortening and Pure soya butter. I also burnt the sugar slightly. The taste was soso (obviously from the burnt sugar) but I also noticed a &#8220;woody&#8221; aftertaste which on day 2 disappeared if that makes sense. Do you know why? The texture and sweetness were perfect tho! So I&#8217;d like to attempt this recipe again!\nThanks,\nGloria",
				"What can I use in replacement of Aquafaba?",
				"Hi!\nI\u2019ve tried your vegan vanilla cake and it was sincerely the best vegan cake I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m trying to make your cake but with raspberry in the \u201cin between\u201d layer along with your Swiss aquafaba buttercream. Would it hold better if I use raspberries instead of the strawberries in this recipe or for whatever reasons raspberries wouldn\u2019t come out the same as strawberries? Would it just be better to make separate layers (one layer buttercream, one layer raspberry jam?)\nThanks!",
				"Hi Eva!\nI would love to make a chocolate Italian meringue buttercream. I was thinking of making a cocoa powder and water mixture and adding instead of the strawberry. Do you think this will work? Thank you! So excited for this recipe \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi Eva,\nHave you tried to use cocoa butter? Or a percentage of cocoa butter with coconut based vegan butter or shortening, if palm oil products is a no go?\nKind regards",
				"What&#8217;s the point of cooking the sugar to 248 if you&#8217;re not using egg whites? Does the aquafaba work in a swiss style buttercream, where you combine and cook it with the sugar before beating?",
				"Hi Eva!\nI hope this isn\u2019t a silly question&#8230;..but is there a way to be successful with this recipe without using a thermometer? I do not have a way to get one before I hope to use this recipe.\nThanks in advance!\n(P.S. LOVE your name&#8230;.Eva is my middle name ?)",
				"I&#8217;m hoping to make this cake this weekend for a birthday, and I get the feeling that it would be ok to make the frosting the day before and store in the fridge? Making it the day of the party will just make me SUPER nervous.\nWill it compromise the texture as long as I don&#8217;t rewhip it after taking it out of the fridge?",
				"Hello! I made this IMBC yesterday to cover your ultra yummy white cake recipe. The IMBC had a beautiful texture but no flavor! I added more vanilla and it just tasted like nothing.  It was for a paying customer so I hope they like it. But any ideas on how to get more flavor in it??",
				"Hello Eva,\nI am planning to make this frosting soon and I am wondering if I could replace the shortening and buttery sticks with simply vegan butter? And one more thing, maybe a bit silly but still, in what form should I add it to the meringue (softened or liquid?)?\nThank you very much in advance!\nBest regards,\nKarolina",
				"Hi there, I will be attempting to make the chocolate cake along with this frosting. Is 10 cups enough for a 3 tier cake like you made only I\u2019m using 9 inch pans?? Thank you!",
				"Gorgeous cake! (I wonder what textural difference you might get by using powdered, freeze-dried strawberries instead of strawberry syrup&#8211;a la Bravetart.) Thanks for the awesome recipe!"

There is no comparison.  The cake literally melts in your mouth.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I look forward to making it again and having you share your frosting recipe.  I used a vegan vanilla buttercream.  Not as glamorous as yours, but very satisfying and delicious just the same.  Gorgeous pictures.  Makes you want to lick the screen!!",

I used Miyoko&#8217;s vegan butter (baking/unsalted kind) because I was out of coconut oil and it works great too, though I do think they didn&#8217;t spread as much as they would have with coconut oil. They also didn&#8217;t brown very much, but could&#8217;ve been my oven. Will try again with coco oil next time!",

				"This is such a reliable recipe &#8211; I brought them to work and two people have asked for the recipe. What I particularly love is how flexible these cookies are. I&#8217;ve made them 3 times now and each time have had to stray slightly because I didn&#8217;t have all the correct ingredients, or used slightly different cooking times, or even had to hand-whip the wet ingredients in absence of an electric mixer: on every occasion they&#8217;ve still turned out YUM. I&#8217;ve also been melting my (stiff) tahini in a pot, which creates a nice smooth consistency and adds a slightly more roasted-nut flavour.",
				"Best cookies ever!  Crispy edges and soft and gooey in the Center. Thank you!",
				"Love the flavor, but mine turned out quite hard and crumbly. Hard to bite into after storing for several days. I&#8217;m hoping this was just as simple as baking them too long. Going to try again this weekend and keep a closer eye on the bake time!",

				"Just made these and they turned out amazing! Awesome recipe! Didn\u2019t have granulated sugar, so used all brown sugar. Also, I used a flavored chocolate coconut tahini which worked surprisingly well. I also substituted flour for the cornstarch, but didn\u2019t seem to make a difference. Loved the chopped dark chocolate bits, we will definitely be making again! Texture turned out great too!!",
				"There turned out absolutely Devine. I usually get them at a local bakery, but now I can make them and they taste identical!",
				"I made these with some modifications; I used Himalayan Pink Salt instead of sea salt and extra dark chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate. It was far more delicious than regular chocolate chip cookies.",
				"Hey Lois!\nI made them with Bob&#8217;s Red Mill 1 to 1 and they turned out perfectly. Maybe they spread a little bit less than Eva&#8217;s but I find this is always the case with gf cookies.",

				"Since quarantine I\u2019ve made these 4 times- 3 times with the intent of mailing them as care packages except my S.O. (who is a chef btw) and I keep eating them lol!! Last night I made them again with oat milk (instead of almond), coconut milk that had begun to liquify a bit, and a different non-organic tahini and one of those 3 things (or perhaps all) made them a little oilier than normal but still extremely delicious. So happy to have stumbled across your blog! Making my way through your Indian recipes, too, and they are great!",

I had my doubts but was quickly a member of team tahini cookies! When I became a vegan 11 months ago, I never dreamt I could have such a decadent treat again! You put me on the path of dreams come true! I did manage to throw in some oats, after which I added a splash more of almond milk. May I suggest people play around with the type of chocolate bars they choose for the recipe? I had a coffee flavored one and one with nibs and the coffee was just the right amount, though I didn&#8217;t fancy it as a candy bar, though it was from a gift pack of vegan chocolate bars. Finally, I&#8217;m in dreamland again! Thank you!",

				"Made a quarantine \u201cuse what you have\u201d edition of these with walnut oil in place of the coconut oil and an extra TBSP of flour and they turned out so well (I did refrigerate the dough longer to be safe). No extra spread at all. If we\u2019d had any chopped walnuts I\u2019d have added those too. Hurray for flexible, foolproof recipes!\n???",

I dodn&#8217;t have any more vegan butter in hand so I went for&#8230;.crisco, I know, I know. The cookies did not spread at all after 15 minutes, so I baked them way longer, without any success, they are crumbly and feel like the sugar never disolved at all!

I used coconut sugar in place of brown but in my experience that doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ll skip adding any milk next time and add flour. They tasted very good, but didn&#8217;t resemble yours at all.",

I\u2019m from the UK &amp; I\u2019ve found it near impossible to get a decent recipe for a simple, tasty, plain \u201csteak\u201d without strange marinades. I\u2019m so pleased I found this &amp; look forward to trying it in different ways.",
				"This recipe is delicious!!! One of the hardest things for me to give up when going vegan was steak. I never thought it would be possible to have a true vegan steak. My husband was really pushing trying vital wheat gluten. So I gave it a shot with your recipe and I&#8217;m so glad I did. We have this quite frequently. I use this recipe to marinade to make vegan carne asada as well. It&#8217;s just so good!!",
				"I don&#8217;t have any chickpea flour. Should I substitute with vital wheat gluten or plain flour?",

				"So excited! Do you store them in the fridge in the foil or just a sealed container? Or both? Thank you!",
				"Hi,\nI&#8217;m pretty new to vegan cooking and am learning a lot!  I&#8217;ve never heard of Seitan and you said you could buy it.

Your recipe sounds amazing, but I&#8217;m allergic to coconut (nuts and peanuts too \ud83e\udd74), is there a way to substitute it and still have a &#8220;cheese&#8221; consistency?\nIn any case thanks for the effort you clearly made put in your recipes, I&#8217;ll try the asada this weekend!!",
				"We&#8217;ve used it to make enchiladas, salad and pizza.  It does soften on the pizza crust when you bake it, but not to the point of spilling over.",

				"Amazing! I put this on setain asada tacos and it was wonderful",
				"Good flavor but doesn&#8217;t taste anything like queso fresco to me. The texture is somewhat crumbly but wet like a goat cheese. Barely any tang and I wish I&#8217;d added more citrus. The onion power imparts a nice flavor but that plus some of the remaining tofu flavor make it taste really different from queso fresco. I think this would be amazing on a bagel as is or with more herbs and spices.",
				"This recipe is amazing! I feel like it would be perfect in taquitos, enchiladas or quesadillas but I&#8217;m curious if it&#8217;s possible to use it in anything that&#8217;s going into a hot pan or oven because I imagine the coconut oil would melt into a liquid state. Have you tried using it like that before?",

				"Loved this and have made it more than once now. Blanching the tofu really helps neutralize the tofu flavor.  Just for the fun of it, one time I added 1 preserved lemon to your fabulous original recipe which really bumped up the tanginess (which I love). Thank you so much for sharing.",
				"My cheese still in the fridge solidifying but I have just tried the cheese scraped with homemade bread and it tasted pretty good! I have made other cheese sauce before and didn&#8217;t like it but this one seems promising. I used garlic powder because I didn&#8217;t have onion powder, and used canola oil instead of the coconut oil. I used what I have. Thank you for sharing!",
				"Is coconut oil necessary or can you use a different oil?",
				"This cheese is delicious! I admit, I was skeptical, because like you, I had tried tofu based cheeses before and could not get past that beany taste, but I can&#8217;t detect that at all with this cheese! I have already eaten way too much of this! I put it on pasta, on top of salads, and spread on toast mixed with sun-dried tomatoes and diced onions. Thank you so much for creating these delicious vegan recipes!",
				"I made this once before and loved it!  I decided to make it again this morning, but didn\u2019t have any onion powder.  I subbed it with Everything but the Bagel seasoning!  It tastes so good!  I can\u2019t wait to have it tonight.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe.",
				"I discovered this recipe a few weeks ago and fell in love with it immediately.  It has to be one of the tastiest, easy to make dairy free cheese recipes ever.  I&#8217;ve been adding dill leaves and fennel seeds or dill leaves and finely minced sundried tomatoes to mine and the flavour is sooooooooooooo good.    Not a day goes by when I don&#8217;t have some of this truly amazing cheese &#8211; I can&#8217;t stop eating it.  And I&#8217;ve been sharing the recipe wherever I can.  Thank you so much for creating such an incredible recipe.",

I was so excited at the prospect of having some of this as leftovers for lunch the next day but my dreams were shattered when my husband (the non vegan and fussy eater) finished every last bit.

The tofu was so cheese like in texture it made  one forget that there was no cheese inside the dish ,  I used about three times the amount of nutritional yeast called for in the recipe.

I also use thawed frozen spinach which seems to need maybe double the water. I like to add quite a bit of lemon juice at the end and I use double the ginger. Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe!",
				"Made this tonight but slightly adapted to what was available: I used frozen spinach, thawed out and blended. Also smoked tofu!!\nI must admit I needed to add a lot of water and some extra salt.\nThe result was truly delicious and your spice blend was perfect.

I did not have the barley malt syrup but they turned out just fine",

Delicious!!!   I substituted 1 tsp of molasses instead of the 2 tsp of  barley malt syrup and the colour worked perfectly.  I put the molasses into the warm water and added the 2 tsp of yeast and proofed it for about 6 minutes.  After the mixer I kneaded for 6 minutes.  I also used microwave-melted margarine instead of plant milk for brushing the tops of buns and I brushed the leftover margarine several times between uses onto the knife to make the slits. I will definitely make these again!  Thank you for this no-fail recipe.",

If you want a more authentic Cajun flavor, instead of garlic + scallions for the base, start with a combination of onion + celery + bell pepper, then the garlic and add top with the green part of the scallion when serving.

Next the biryani, my favourite indian dish, so fingers crossed.",

I got the sauce and the cheese done early.  The crepe batter I only left for 20 mins but the little tester worked fine.  I did add a red onion to the spinach.  \nMy vegan wife loved all four elements.  She found the sauce exquisite (no exaggeration) and I thought the cheese was better than my former almond cheese recipe.  Really cheesy.  \nI&#8217;d recommend these need eating out the pan (immediately).

I also don&#8217;t like tofu (a picky vegan for 16 years, it&#8217;s terrible!), but these didn&#8217;t taste tofu-y at all. I had a 300 gr box of firm tofu and maybe 75gr of silken tofu, so I used both. Only needed 1/4c of cornflour and they turned out really nice with that very long bake at high heat. We found the flavor very low key, so making them again, I would kick up all the spices by quite a bit. Definitely a keeper though. Thanks.",
				"I made this tonight and it was phenomenal!  If you are thinking about making this please do.  It was so delicious!! Thank you so much for a great recipe.",
				"I almost never leave reviews on food blogs (or anywhere really), but this is one of the best recipes that I have ever made! I could not believe that I had made something that tastes like it could be served at a restaurant. This is one of my favourite recipes of all time and have already made it multiple times. If there are any leftovers (rare), it also makes a great hiking snack (packed separately and using the sauce as a dip)!! Thank you so much for this recipe!",
				"Made this and loved it!!!\nOne thing I did change was that I didnt have regular yellow potatoes (went to grab then from the pantry and they had loooong roots&#8230;lol) so I used steamed sweet potatoes and man, it was divine! I also couldn&#8217;t find fenugreek, so omitted it, and it was still so good. Highly recommend. I went the baking route, finished in my air fryer and the kofta was great!\nThanks for this recipe.",
				"I love this recipe! So does my non vegan husband and family! Can these be frozen? I&#8217;d like to make up a big batch and have extras for a quick dinner. I&#8217;ll freeze the sauce prior to adding the coconut milk.",
				"I want to prepare this for my son\u2019s birthday . My question is do I have to crush the frozen peas or do I add them as a whole ? Thank you",
				"Could I use squeezed okara for this instead of tofu? Always desperate for ways to use it up!",
				"So good, sauce is awesome",
				"PS\nwe did think that they were maybe missing a sweet note so next time we&#8217;re also going to add some raisins \ud83d\ude42",
				"Made these for the family last night and they turned out perfect!  Although not strictly vegan my hubby doesn&#8217;t eat land animals and is lactose intolerant so avoids dairy.  I also am keen to transition to a more plant based diet so vegan versions of our favourite meals are great for easing us all into healthier eating and these Malai Kofta certainly fit the bill perfectly!\nRecipe came together easily &#8211; I used my potato ricer to mash the potatoes and the tofu and the kids rolled the koftas.  I choose to deep fry the balls at the temp specified in your recipe and they held together perfectly and came out lovely and crunchy on the outside and deliciously creamy inside.  I followed the suggestion of serving the koftas and sauce separately meaning the balls stayed nice and crisp and we all agreed they were amazing.\nSeems like a recipe that would freeze really well to.  Next time I&#8217;ll be making a double or triple batch, lightly frying the balls I wish to freeze, laying them on a tray to freeze they packing in vacuum bags to freeze long term.  That way I should be able to finish cooking the balls in the oven (if I had an air fryer that would be even better I think) and simply reheat the sauce in a pot for a super fast and easy busy day meal.\nThanks for a great recipe!!  Looking forward to trying some of your others.",
				"This is most delicious! Thank you for sharing.\nI baked the kofta. The sauce is amazing. I am going to use the sauce recipe for my next go at butter chicken.\nHappy New Year.",
				"THIS IS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! \ud83d\ude00\nWe used the air fryer for the dumplings for 11-12 min. and they turned out so perfectly! I&#8217;m in love with the flavors!!! Thank you for this recipe!",
				"Hi,\nCan you freeze the dumpling mixture? Thanks!",
				"Hello! This recipe looks great! Quick question &#8211; can I use dry peas instead of frozen ones? If so, should I cook them first? Thanks!",
				"Thanks, I went ahead and purchased Yukons.  Great recipe.  Thanks!",
				"Anyone try this with regular Idaho potatoes?  Have them on hand, but no Yukon.",
				"This was so delicious! My non-vegan family loved it, too! I baked the kofta and they were light and fluffy and went perfectly with the curry sauce. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Can I mix the tofu and potato, leave it in the fridge overnight, then bring to room temperature and fry the next day?",
				"Delicious! Tofu &amp; potatoes make the perfect combination for vegan malai kofta. Love this recipe. Thank you.",
				"I deep  fried several kofta balls that looked like they were crisping nicely but then fell apart when I tried to turn them&#8230; the dough also stuck to the bottom of the pan something awful. Then I reread the temperature for the recipe and realized I was frying them at 250 instead of the 300 to 350 degrees per the recipe.  Such a sad waste of the first bits of dough.  But once I corrected the temperature everything came out beautifully, soft on the inside crunchy on the outside and oh so tasty!!   I made both fried and baked kofta.  I probably left the baked kofta  in oven a bit too long as they flattened out and also had a \u201chollow\u201d center.  They were also very crunchy  on the outside. They wound up looking more like a cookie than a meatball. Probably not ideal shape &amp; texture, but very tasty in their own right. (Could probably serve as a crunchy appetizer&#8230;..The next time I make the baked ones  I would follow the temperature and time more carefully as I think I may have baked them a little too long.. I made the sauce the next day and reheated the kofta  in the oven on a baking tray.   I have never had kofta before, so I can\u2019t compare, but I have to say everything tasted  fabulous!  I would give this 5 out of 5 stars and would 100 percent make these again!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!",
				"Hi, this was delicious, I am making it for the second time today after my daughter requested it for her birthday dinner after she had it the first time a couple months ago!  It tastes so much like my favorite Indian restaurant&#8217;s version of this dish!   However, I have to suggest you revise the preparation time.  I&#8217;m not an inexperienced or inefficient cook, this is my second go at this recipe, and I have just completed making the balls and it took me a full hour to make and get them in the oven.  Peeling potatoes, mashing them up and mashing up the tofu, not to mention forming the balls&#8211;I can&#8217;t imagine that anyone could do even this part in just 15 minutes!!!  I assume I could make the sauce while they bake (I&#8217;m going to make the sauce a bit later) but even so that would take a full hour and a half of active time to get this meal on the table.  Nonetheless it&#8217;s well worth all the time and effort!",
				"I can&#8217;t believe how good this is! Even baked, the kofta were still fluffy. I&#8217;m so glad I came across your site. Thanks a million!",
				"Hi Eva, could you use chick pea flower instead of corn flower?\nMany Thanks\nRaj",
				"??? this is amazing thank you for sharing!!",
				"I made this and it was terrific. I used no oil and just 1/4 cup corn starch (as opposed to 1/2 cup) and the  dumplings held together just fine.  I recommend making a double or even triple batch of the sauce because I had way more dumplings than sauce with the above recipe.",
				"This looks great! Just curious though, if you want the tofu smooth, why not use silken tofu?",
				"I made this today and I&#8217;ve never left a comment on a recipe before. Although my baked koftas flattened in the oven (like cookies, I assume because it was too wet) they were delicious and the sauce was brilliant. My entire family couldn&#8217;t stop eating them including my picky preschooler who kept eating them from my plate. Thank you for this and I plan on making many more of your dishes.",
				"This looks amazing!! My mom is going to make this &amp; I&#8217;m so excited! I will let you know how it goes \ud83d\ude42 \np.s. all the recipes on here look incredible! You&#8217;re an amazing chef.",
				"You\u2019re a fantastic cook.",
				"i made this tonight and used a little oil for baking.  It was amazing! My husband and I both loved it and even my mother in law (who eats very little) kept eating and eating!  I will definitely be making this again.",
				"I can&#8217;t wait to try this, it looks delicious! Is it necessary to put oil on them before baking?",
				"This is a great recipe, I have made a few times now, shared the recipe with friends at work, they love it too!",
				"Hi&#8230; I run a charity group providing fresh cooked, nutritionally balanced, tasty hot lunches ( vegetarian) to children in low decile ( poor) schools&#8230; we have been going for 6 years providing approx. 1000 meals / week ( all cooked on the same day and delivered to various schools)&#8230;The last day of term we like to do something special for the kids and was searching on internet for inspiration and found this recipe for kofta malai&#8230; Of course ,I will need to multiply the recipe by 100x ( for example the 1/4 cup cashews in the sauce becomes 3.5kg cashews) but I am excited to try this out with the kids next week and expose them to new flavours&#8230; I will combine it with a rice dish and a cake or trifle for a complete lunch&#8230; I will use homemade panir ( milk curd) instead of tofu because of cost considerations.. anyway, thanks for the recipe and your website..I let you know how it goes!\nIf you have s few minutes and would like to check out more of our lunch in schools program in NZ, there is a short documentary here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IxkgG6FNYg4&#038;t=287s\nMany thanks..best wishes&#8230;buddhi",
				"wooooow,amazing dish.greetings from israel",
				"Thank you for this recipe! The sauce is so good! I did something a little different for the kofta &#8211; instead of potatoes, I used yuca. And instead of frying, I added some coconut oil and cooked in the belgium waffle maker.",
				"Rolled in Panko, good idea! I\u2019m going to try that next. I agree, Kristine, this is better than eating out! \nGreat recipe, thecuriouschickpea!\nMaggie",

				"And my toddler loves them!",
				"I have made these multiple times and they always come out great! I have even frozen some of the dough when batch cooking, and although it thaws a bit soggy, the kofta balls still come out of the oven with the perfect texture, you just have to work quickly with the dough to get it into the oven.",
				"Hi! I made this beautiful recipe last night. The sad part was i didn&#8217;t have heavy cream or kasuri methi (i added fenugreek seeds instead) but it still turned out good but every time i took a bite, i kept thinking that something was missing!! Is heavy cream absolutely necessary for this recipe? if yes, can you suggest some substitute for it?\nThank you! \ud83d\ude42",
				"I&#8217;ve made this twice now. The first time I didn&#8217;t have the fenugreek leaves and it was good, but tonight I added the leaves and wow! What a difference! This is absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for sharing!",

				"I went vegan (from vegetarian) about eight months ago and malai kofta/paneer makhani sauce was the one thing I\u2019ve been desperately craving ever since. When I came across your recipe, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect and was a bit doubtful that it would taste as good as the real thing, but I decided to give it a try and it was AMAZING! If I didn\u2019t make it myself, I wouldn\u2019t believe it was vegan. Thank you so much for filling this void in my life \ud83d\ude42",
				"Made the Malai Kofta and it was delicious. Especially the creamy sauce. That was as good as the sauce I get at my favourite Indian restaurant . Going to try making the naan next\nThank you",
				"This is an excellent dish, so thank you for sharing!! My husband who is not vegan loved it so much he ate it three days in a row until all kofta were gone. Although the kofta and sauce was delish, seeing the picture of your balls, I know that mine did not cook properly. I meant to deep fry and tried following the recipe which says to put 2 inches of oil in a pan on med-low. I must have ended up doing more of a pan fry because the outside wasn&#8217;t a deep golden brown and pieces of the kofta fell off into the pan during the process. I think that next time it will require a higher temp &#8211; maybe more like a med-high and more oil so that the entire ball is submerged in oil.",
				"I made a half recipe tonight and it turned out great.  I did bake the koftas rather than frying, but otherwise (almost) followed the recipe as written.  I did soak the cashews, as I worried they might not blend well.  i also sauteed the onion a bit before adding the tomatoes.  Lastly, I added some roasted jalapeno (I had half of one in the fridge I needed to use) and some red chili pepper in place of the cayenne and was quite happy to have a very spicy tomato gravy.",
				"I just made this tonight! We loved it. All had seconds. I doubled the cayenne based on the author\u2019s comments but otherwise did the recipe as directed. It took me quite a bit longer than the recipe indicated, but it might go faster the next time. I may make the meatballs the day before another time. But there will be a next time!",
				"I made these yesterday since we did our official Christmas dinner a few days ago. These are delicious! And the sauce! To die for! I want to put it on everything from now on!",
				"This was soooooo good! It\u2019s going into the regular dinner rotation. Thanks!",
				"My husbands favorite Indian dish is malai Kofta but I am allergic to dairy. I made this last night and everyone in the family LOVED it! so tasty. I fried the dumplings. I think I may serve them on the table to be made one at a time because that first one- with the outside crispy and the inside soft was so amazing. After a bit the sauce makes them soft. Still good&#8230;but man that first one!\nThank you!",
				"I like the idea of a vegan dish. Could one not make this with a vegan ricotta? The recipe sounds delish. Cannot wait to try it. Yummy",
				"I forgot to rate it!\n5*",
				"Made the sauce to go with some pre-made pakoras&#8230;\nit is truly *amazing* !!!\nI was skeptical with no frying, but seriously this is awesome, thank you!",
				"Meant to say super delicious**\nI read the other comment about adding more arrowroot powder so will try that! \n\ud83d\ude42",
				"Hey, I made this last night and it was upset delicious. However, I tried both baking and frying the kofta and they didn\u2019t turn out writhe times. When frying they just kind of stuck to the bottom of the pan and mostly fell apart even though I did roll them into a ball/little patty. When I baked them the insides were mostly hollow. They browned on the outside but the insides must have leaked out. Would I just need to add more arrowroot powder and make them firmer? Thank you for this amazing recipe!",
				"Was very excited to try this tonight, but for some reason all the kofta completely fell apart when I fried them. Before I  put them in the pot they were perfect little balls, so it should have worked. I ended up throwing all of it away and just buying veggieballs from the  store. Do you have any idea what could have gone wrong? I really want to make this recipe work!",
				"We made this tonight&#8230;.it was amazing! Enough for tomorrow. We will definitely make it again. &#8230;.loved the flavors. Accidentally put in astofaeda instead of fenugreek&#8230;.and then added it after all. Still tasted ok, I think. Thanks so much&#8230;. hoping to try out some of your others",
				"Thank you for this recipe!! I have made it on 2 occasions and has gone down a treat both times. I had a friend who would usually turn down a meal without meat say it was the best curry he had ever eaten.\nI substituted half the potato for sweet potato, twice the amount of cashews and chilli flakes for some heat x",
				"This dish was absolutely amazing!! Thank you for sharing!",
				"Thank you for the recipe\nI did have an issue with it though. The dough for the koftas came out way too wet and I had to add a lot more cornstarch. I&#8217;m thinking this is because I don&#8217;t have a scale so I had to estimate my tofu and potatoes, or because I processed the entire dough mixture instead of mashing the potatoes by hand.\nI deep fried the koftas and they stuck to the bottom of the deep fryer basket. Also, some of them burst open with a loud pop! I suppose the pressure from the heat became too much for them?\nThe sauce came out well. It was easy and came out tasting pretty similar to sauces I&#8217;ve had at Indian restaursnts even though I couldn&#8217;t find the fenugreek and omitted it.\nI&#8217;m going to try this recipe again but using a scale and not processing the dough\nMy recommendations are to add raisins and cashew pieces to the kofta dough. They need more texture and flavor\nThe best kofta I&#8217;ve had has raisins in it and the sweetness really complements the savory flavors well\nDo you have any other recommendations for fixing the mistake I made ?",
				"This is absolutely delicious! Fancy, but fairly easy to put together. The sauce is so good and the potato balls are crispy and delightful\nWould highly suggest making!",
				"Hi Eva, thanks for the great recipe! I just ate it all and it was so delicious and creamy and tasty&#8230; lovely!",
				"I\u2019m sitting waiting for the  kofta to bake and if they aren\u2019t finished soon the sauce is going to be gone!  It is absolutely amazing!   We like things a little spicy in my house so I added some extra cayenne pepper. I could seriously eat it all!   Can\u2019t wait to taste the kofta!",
				"As a vegan, a major miss has been Malai kofta [that and shahi paneer too \ud83d\ude09 ] Just finished eating this for dinner! It turned out phenomenally. We added a bit more cashews for extra nuttiness. The winning aspect was the kofta!  The consistency was perfect. Thanks so much for blessing our taste buds with this dish!",
				"Thank you so much with this recipe! I made the sauce today (with potatoes, peas and paneer instead of the dumplings) and I loved it.",
				"I want to attempt these in my air fryer. I just made some wonderful falafel in it, which worked out great, so I began thinking, why not malai kofta too?\nI love malai kofta, and really miss not eating it since becoming vegan. Your recipe has great comments, so I trust your spice mix! Often Indian recipes online don\u2019t taste at all like restaurant food, but yours looks great!\nThanks!",
				"I really want to try this durng the weekend! But I want to ask if the kofta balls are mixed in a food processor or just mixed by hand? If mixed in a food processor it will result in smooth texture throughout the ball, but then I don&#8217;t get the specific point of frozen peas. So maybe they&#8217;re too be left whole in the mix?  Thanks!",
				"My family loves this recipe! Aside from Vegetable Korma, this Malai Kofta is my kids favorite dish! I add raisins to the veggie balls to sweeten it up. Tonight will be my third time making this recipe!  It\u2019s our go to Birtbday dinner recipe! Thank you so much!",

				"Hi Eva,\nThanks for your reply! I did try it without dialling down the baking powder. The flavour was superb but I guess the leavening was a little too much and I ended up with a cakier brownie. I hadn\u2019t fed my starter in a few days but it must be pretty vigorous (!) so I will try 1/4 tsp less of baking powder next time and see how it goes. Maybe even just the acidity of the starter was enough to kick off some extra rising power? Anyway, it was a fun experiment and they were still delicious, just different than anticipated.\nI love using my SD discard in all sorts of things (especially waffles and pizza dough) but am just getting into applying it to cakes etc. It seems especially delicious with chocolatey things! I got the idea from King Arthur Flour website.  So smart ?\nAnd either way this brownie recipe is a keeper!",

I\u2019m thinking of trying that next time but wondering if I should dial down the baking powder a smidge (my starter is pretty active). Any thoughts? I was thinking of trying 120g of starter (and so I\u2019d be cutting 60g each of plant milk and flour from the recipe), if that helps at all.\nThanks!\n(Also, thanks again for always including grams in your baking recipes!)",

				"So delicious, I get this dish at every Indian restaurant and this vegan version was fantastic!! Rich, creamy and delicious. Will definitely make it again.",
				"Just made the recipe this evening for my wife, daughter,  and son-in-law (daughter &amp; son-in-law are vegan).  They LOVED it !!  \u201cBest Indian dish you\u2019ve made\u201d was the consensus comments.  I stuck pretty much to the recipe, \u2014 increased all the spices a bit (other than the cayenne pepper), put more peas in it, and while it was all cooking together added another can of tomatoes to the pot (so it definitely needed more salt).\nLoved the recipe, keep \u2018em coming!\n&#8211; Jack, Arlington VA",
				"Very delicious! I love all of your curry recipes! When I weighed the cauliflower in grams it ended up being a whole head. The sauce was too thick to blend so I added another can of coconut milk and it was delicious and creamy \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb I tripled the tofu also because we love tofu in this family. I love that these recipes always make 6 servings so my husband and I can get three meals out of them!",
				"I get such a longing for India when I make a curry like this. So grateful to have learned this recipe &#8211; it took me right back to my travels. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
				"@Anu, thanks for the hint to let it settle in the fridge for a day. I&#8217;ll do that, if there&#8217;s any left!",
				"Delicious! Will definitely make this again!",
				"Love this recipe! So healthy, yet so creamy and delicious. I have made this a bunch of times. My husband lovves it. We like it with a bit more garam masala and cayenne and also find that all the flavors really really meld into each other after a day in the fridge.",
				"Omg such an amazing end result. Couldn\u2019t tell the difference looking at the gravy that it\u2019s not Shahi Paneer but Tofu Matar. Wish I could post a pic up. Thanks! Great recipe.",
				"Thank you so much for this wonderful and delicious recipe! Everything was amazing. I cooked the tofu in the air fryer first to save a bit of time and then saut\u00e9ed with the spices as directed. The whole family enjoyed this.. thank you again!",
				"This recipe is delicious!!  I have tried many vegan mattar paneer recipes but this one is the most authentic tasting! Thank you. My family loved it."

				"This was so easy and delicious (and cheap)! I made two changes, I added one tablespoon of lemon juice at the beginning instead of the sliced lemons, and I added the kale just 5-7 minutes before the cooking time was done so it maintained its bright green color .  The flavors were great, this will be lunch for me for a few days this week.",
				"Maybe I cut my lemons too thin because they completely disintegrated and my dish was so bitter I could barely eat it.  I used brown rice so I cooked it longer so maybe that played a role as well.  I added steamed broccoli instead of kale and that was good.  Will try again with thicker slices lemon and maybe fewer as well.",
				"Loved this recipe. I made it was brown rice and I  didn\u2019t have chickpeas, so I used 3 15 Oz. cans of Canellini beans and baby kale. I like less rice, so next time, I think I\u2019ll add more kale and less rice."

				"Added more salt and pepper for more depth. Kids loved it with just olive oil. Will make again.",
				"This turned out brilliantly. I left out the pepper because I was making ravioli and wanted a blank canvas. Am toying with the idea of steeping some turmeric in the aquafaba to give the pasta more of a yellow color. This recipe made 36 ravioli. The texture of the dough both when rolling and after its cooked is absolutely gorgeous! Just the right amount of toothsome. Hopefully nothing crazy happens in the freezer. Thanks for sharing!",
				"Hey&#8230;. I have made pasta a few times and always intend to make a batch extra to dry out and use later. When i make the dough just with water and dry it out its great till about even two months. But will using aquafaba also enable me to dry out the pasta and use it later? and what will be the approximate life in such case?",
				"My previous comment meant to say Cacio e pepe.  Auto correct made it almost unreadable, sorry.  And thanks for the recipe.",
				"These would be great in a vegan Caio e pepe.  I won&#8217;t post the link so I don&#8217;t look like I&#8217;m trying to promote a bother site, but there is a decent recipe for vegan cacao e pepe out on the web from New York Times.  Subbing dry pasta for this pasta is going to make for a delicious vegan pasta dish.",
				"How would using semolina flour change the recipe? Also, what kind of flavor does the pasta take on using chickpea aquafaba? Thanks!",
				"Do you think this is possible using chickpea flour and no oil?",
				"I did use a food processor the first time. \nI made some again yesterday with a pasta roller and it was great! I did add an extra half tablespoon of olive oil anyway just in case and it was wonderful. \nNow I just need to get something to make the ravioli making process easier lol.",
				"Thank you! Made this as ravioli on Friday for World Pasta Day and it turned out fantastic! I&#8217;m omni and my partner is vegetarian and we try and incorporate vegan as much as possible into our diet. \nI&#8217;d never made pasta at home before and I decided since I&#8217;d never learnt how to make it might as well try and learn to make a good vegan pasta! I&#8217;m omni and my partner is vegetarian and we try and incorporate vegan as much as possible into our diet.\nMost recipes online I saw looked quite bland so I decided to give this one a go since you really seemed to know what you&#8217;re talking about and the cracked pepper looked very nice! \nI hand rolled my pasta, hoping to soon buy a pasta machine, and it worked really well! I couldn&#8217;t roll it out as thin as I liked but that was too be expected.\nThe one thing I may change when I make this again is to add more oil as I noticed the dough got quite dry and tougher to work with as I shaped the ravioli. I&#8217;m sure that wouldn&#8217;t be an issue if I was just making fettuccine. \nAs for another comment saying the pasta was chewy, I agree but it may be because my pasta was just thicker to begin with and also double up on the ravioli edge. But I really loved the texture!",
				"I just made this tonight and ermergerd! So good. I used 1/2 semolina and 1/2 AP but didn\u2019t reduce the aquafaba. I took a piece of pasta to check fineness and it was *buttery* and delicious. Thank you!",
				"I was wondering if I could use the same recipe with spelt flour?",
				"I became interested in this recipe because my child has an egg allergy.. I have found since that she can actually eat egg yolks but not the whites, I plan to make this recipe but  substitute the whites with aquafaba (I&#8217;ll keep the yolks in).",
				"I just made this tonight &#8211; it was my first time ever making my own pasta &#8211; and it couldn&#8217;t have gone more perfectly. The dough was smooth and beautiful. I think I&#8217;m making more tomorrow night! Thanks!",
				"Should I be allowing the reduced aquafaba to cool before making the dough? Or am I ok to use it straight from the saucepan while it\u2019s hot?",
				"I made the pasta perfectly and all was well!\nBut then after cooking the pasta it was mushy and didn\u2019t seem cooked! Tried varying cooking times but didn\u2019t seem to change anything!\nAny ideas?",
				"Last year I used this recipe for fresh tortellini and it worked brilliantly. I\u2019m about to use it again for ravioli. Thanks for sharing. I do use a food processor because it does a better job of getting things mixed evenly and I use a pasta roller. I cannot and would not roll by hand! It would take too long and it would dry out. Thank you. I just tried to give you 5 stars but think I might have given you less so if I have apologies!",
				"I followed this recipe to  the letter and was only able to make noodles with about 1/4 of the pasta dough. The rest of it either crumbled  and fell apart as I rolled it out or or was too hard and unable to roll out after resting in the fridge. I tried to moisten my hands when rolling the rested dough out but it didn\u2019t help much &#8211; the dough just got sticky and I had to add more flour. What could have gone wrong? What can I do differently next time? Should I add more liquid or oil next time? The few noodles that I was able to roll out we\u2019re delicious, though.",
				"Is it possible to use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose?",
				"this does not take 12 minutes",
				"Thanks for this recipe! I\u2019m wondering if the process would be the same is using a gluten free flour mix? My husband is unfortunately gluten free as well as egg free, and finding a recipe that works for fresh pasta dough has been nearly impossible.",
				"I just made a 1/4 batch following your recipe and I am making these for use as cannelloni.\nI rolled out by hand after letting the mixed dough relax for about a half and hour.\nRolling by had is a lot of work but what I noticed is that after making the folds the dough did not want to roll out thin anymore so I figured letting it rest again might help. Another rest of half an hour seemed to help, though it was still pretty tough to get it thin. I am happy with the result and have under cooked them to start with because they will cook more when they are filled and covered with sauce.  I am no pasta expert but they seem a little tough (maybe because I undercooked them) but I think they will be fine for my use.\nThank you for posting the recipe."

If so, s should the dough ball sit out for a couple of hours before going into the fridge? A nd then how soon should it be taken out for shaping before the bake?\nI&#8217;d like to start these tomorrow and bake and serve the day after, just to cut down on stress&#8230;\nHow&#8217;s that for being a pain?

As I was mixing up the filling, my eye fell upon a fresh batch of dukka, so I tossed a T of that into the mix.\nThey were lovely to watch swelling up (must&#8217;ve been the steam from the leeks, I&#8217;m not sure if they should have puffed, but they did, then collapsed a bit when turned over.\nOf course, we had it with the red-pepper chutney, which has now taken up permanent residence in the fridge.\nFor the next time, I&#8217;m thinking of preheating a half-sheet pan with some oil and cooking the bolani in the oven &#8212; or would that toughen the dough?\nThanks again for a keeper!\nAll the best,\nCarole"

It is nice, but a bit flavourless &#8211; we do not have great vegetables here, so that might be the reason. What is the trick not to have it too watery? Is the red pepper roasted or just plain?\nThanks for your lamb curry so beautiful.",

				"This was my second attempt at bagels and the first time following this recipe. I weighed the ingredients and loosely followed the instructions &#8211; I kneaded the dough longer than instructed and followed a different boiling recipe. The oven temps and times were off, the bagels didn&#8217;t rise well and the golden color was really difficult to achieve. This adaptation needs work, I appreciate the author&#8217;s feedback in other comments but it seems this recipe is still a work in progress. I won&#8217;t use this recipe again, I&#8217;m sorry to say.",
				"I tried this recipe because it included instructions for a food processor. I misread the recipe and used 1.5 cups of water which seemed fine. Just out of the oven.   Taste great.   Next time I would make 10-12 bagels as they are rather large.",
				"I\u2019ve made these 3 times, doubling the last 2 batches, and the last batch was on point. My dough puffs up in the fridge then collapses with the slightest manipulation, so I reshaped the entire batch, and let it rest another 20 minutes, and boiled them, they puffed up beautifully, and puffed up even more during the bake. I am liberal with the olive oil I use to prevent drying out or sticking to the parchment paper, and I use the same parchment paper throughout and for the bake, the bagels sort of fry a little in the olive oil, which adds a wonderful crunch and a whole new wonderful dimension to these already great great bagels.",
				"This is the recipe/blog-post that keeps on giving, isn&#8217;t it?\nI&#8217;m born and raised in the New York metropolitan area and have eaten dozens and dozens of NY bagels. I worked in a bagel store for most of a school year, a very long time ago, when I was 16, bagging and making sandwiches &#8211; not baking.\nNow living in the Boston area where there are bagels but they&#8217;re not the same. My brother lived here for a while: he accurately described the local bagels as &#8220;rolls.&#8221;\nI followed the recipe, scaling up 150% so that I&#8217;d get a dozen, with two days in the fridge before baking, using a scale to measure, and malt syrup that was available at Whole Foods.  Used bread flour from Lindley Mills (purchased 25 pounds when bread flour was scarce at the beginning of the pandemic).  This dozen, the first I&#8217;ve ever made, included two everything, four onion, and six sesame.  Had a bite while still warm last night and then toasted, straight out of the freezer, this morning for breakfast. Perfect!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! I expect that I&#8217;ll be making these again.",
				"This is a great recipe, as long as I immediately put the dough in the fridge overnight for the first rise in the fridge, and barely do any second rise at all in the morning (just enough time to form the bagels and boil the water/heat the oven). Otherwise they overproof and fall when I boil them, but the \u201creverse\u201d way has worked perfectly for me.",
				"I&#8217;m still confused by the first two steps:\ncombine ingredients in a food processor, let rest for 10 min\nThen Add dry ingredients and wet together in a stand mixer.\nIsn&#8217;t it just take dough from food processor and move to stand mixer or table?",
				"I\u2019ve made these bagels twice now. The first time I didn\u2019t time things well and forgot to preheat the oven, so I think they sat out too long and ended up completely flat (although tasted delicious). I tried for the 2nd time today and while some turned out better, some were still pretty flat. I\u2019m not sure what part of the process I need to improve on? Again, they taste perfect, but just hoping for a higher bagel.  Thanks!",
				"FYI &#8211; a cup of water weighs 236.588 grams.  1 1/3 or 1.33 cups of water weigh 315g, not 350g as the recipe calls for. 350g/236.588g=1.48 cups of water. This really points to the problem with volume measurements.",
				"To follow up, for measuring small amounts a jewlers scale works well, ~$12 on Amazon. Mine measures to a 100th of a gram, granted a bit overkill.",
				"These are very good bagels. \nFor those the have trouble finding bread flour you can use vital wheat gluten(VWG), VTW can be found in most chain grocery stores. This makes it possible to have excellent results with AP flour. I even use it with bread flour since it&#8217;s my opinion bagels work even better with high gulten flour which runs around 14.2% protein. Bread four runs around 12-13%, AP around 10-11%. The formula for caculating how much VWG you need is as follows, make sure you use paretheses as shown: ((target protein percent) &#8211; (source flour protein percent))*(flour amount)/(VWG protein percent &#8211; source flour protein percent).\nIf you want to be very precise take total flour minus the amount of VWG",
				"The dough was very hard to handle after letting the dough proof in the fridge and taking it out  to prepare for the boil.  It is so soft and lost its shape when I picked it up to place in the pot.  I had to reshape them to help firm them up  and wait 10 more mins for another light proofing before boiling.   This was the only way to keep the shape.  Handling it after a long proof is impossible, what am I missing here?",
				"They were delicious !!\nCan they be made into a loaf and baked as bread ?",
				"Hi so I made these for the first time and followed the recipe exactly. I got a pretty stiff dough but my bagels turned out just a little flat. They weren\u2019t like really really flat but just a little. What should I change to make them a little puffier?",
				"I agree that the 1 1/3 cup water wasn\u2019t enough so we added little bit more. No problem. It was great!",
				"I followed your recipe.  They didn\u2019t rise as much as I would like.  They did rise more than another recipe I used.  Any suggestions   I let the yeast foam to be sure it was good. Then I mixed it with the flour and salt",
				"hi! i&#8217;ve been trying different bagel recipes for the last week and they were all just slightly off &#8211; not chewy enough, no crust formed, weird ratios &#8211; but this one worked flawlessly first try, and it was so easy! thanks so much!",
				"My dry malt powder (Hoosier Hill Farm) weighs 5 g for 1 1/2 tsp, instead of 10g as stated in your recipe. Is there a typo there?",
				"can i use barley malt flour in place of the barley malt powder?",
				"Thanks!",
				"So I tripled the dough because I&#8217;m making minis for a baby shower (51-52 gr each).\nGoal was to boil and freeze to bake off the day of the shower but I did a test run on 3 for baking.  Used a pizza stone at 450 with and without a pan of water.  We decided that those baked with the water were less crisp so I will be ditching the water for the final baking.  I noticed that  https://food.briess.com/  recipe uses 2 types of syrup and AP rather than bread flour.  I would not change the flour but have come to the conclusion that what is missing from most other bagels is the complexity of flavor from the malt syrup so I&#8217;d like to try some combinations, and also try and completely replace the yeast with sourdough starter as the long rise/sourdough/syrups all appear  to impact the complexity of the flavor.  Will be searching for starter/kg flour ratios&#8230;. great bagels and I think there will be the hit of the shower!",
				"So, I added a bit of sour dough starter and am doing the overnight proof now.  I think it is important to mention that this can be done first because I am tripling the recipe and would not have room for the formed bagels overnight.  My Kitchenaid did fine with the dough.  I am making mini bagels as I am helping out with a baby shower and no local place- we are looking at a 15 mile radius, makes minis.   \nI plan on freezing partially baked bagels an finishing them the day of the event for a fresh taste.  Any suggestions as to how long I should bake them?\nI do have a stone insert I can use in my oven.  did the pan with water go in under the stone?  I get that is for getting an extra crisp outer dough as one would do for a baguette.  \nany suggestion as to the weight of dough I should be using for a mini bagel?\nThanks!",
				"Since the water boils at a lower temperature can you add something to get it to boil at 212 degrees without altering flavor?",
				"Thanks Eva, I&#8217;ll try that and see what happens.",
				"I haven&#8217;t tried this recipe yet, but it looks like it will do right nice by a New York bagel.  But my question is that I&#8217;ve since moved to northern New Mexico where the elevation is almost 7000 feet.  Is there something I need to do differently to make the bagels work?\nThank you",
				"I&#8217;ve been thinking about making bagels for a week now!  My mixer is broken, so looked for a recipe where I could use my food processor instead.  I made what I might call a PERFECT batch of bagels!  Very excited to have found this.   I did find the dough a little bit dry, so just wetted it a tiny bit when kneading, but I&#8217;ve found this is a common thing with bread-baking.  The only thing I might do next time is make 10 bagels instead of 8.   They are HUGE!  I can&#8217;t wait to try other toppings, only  used sesame seeds this time.  Thank you so much!",
				"Try an egg wash of egg yolk, cream and a dash of salt. My toppings stick like crazy.",
				"OMG! I just made my first batch of homemade bagels and they are awesome! Followed the  recipe to a T although I did use an egg wash which allowed the poppyseed and everything toppings to adhere very well. Used King Arthur bread flour.  As a native New Yorker now living on the West Coast, I can say that these are the best bagels I\u2019ve eaten in a long time.",
				"The flavor is definitely there.  It was so good, my daughter and I were eating raw dough.  I had a huge amount of trouble getting the dough to come together, however.  Ended up using over 1/3 cups more water than the recipe called for, and it was still an extremely dry dough that barely came together, which affected the rise.  I ended up using longer rise as well to compensate for this.  Next time, I think I will go with my feel instead of worrying overly much about what the recipe calls for.  There will be a next time, because the end result is just so good.",
				"I made these using the recipe as is but I used a scale to weigh out all the ingredients &#8211; worked perfectly.  I used diastatic malt powder and a little honey in the poaching liquid because I could not find any malt syrup.  I also used Everything but the Bagel seasoning blend from Trader Joe &#8211; made the topping process a bit easier.. Thanks!",
				"Thank you for this superb recipe that encapsulates so many important points regarding bagel making. After repeated disappointment with store bought which are little more that donut shaped Wonder bread or overpriced and usually only OK bagel shop bagels, I have gone all in on home baking. . \nI just tried it and agree that adding baking soda and salt in addition to malt syrup to the boil gets the perfect crunchy but thin crust. I had a few suggestions about which perhaps other readers can comment:\n1) Since bagels have a bit in common with pizza dough in terms of preparation and ingredients, I have substituted 100g of ripe sourdough starter for 80g of the water, since sourdoughs develop well with long, cool retards. You can cut the instant yeast a bit if you add sourdough\n2) I have had good luck with Korean rice syrup (ssalyeot) that also has a high maltose content. Maltose has a distinct taste unlike sucrose (sugar), melibiose (honey) and most other sweeteners or syrups, and does not contain any fructose. These are available inexpensively at Korean markets in LA or in general at Asian markets or on Amazon.\n3) Most baking flours contain malt that includes enzymes that break down starch into sugars, improving yeast action and rise. You can overdo it with diastatic powder but 1/2 tsp seems to work well. Please understand that non-diastatic syrup or powder is for flavor whereas diastatic powder contains enzymes. You can purchase a decade&#8217;s worth of diastatic malt powder (1.5 lb.) on Amazon for ~$10. Malt powder is also great for baiting mouse traps!\n4) Flour is key to all baking. For bagels, I prefer General Mills All-Trumps that has 14.2% protein, which is higher than bread flours. The protein is important to get the right &#8216;chew&#8217;. Some of the other strong flours such as KA Sir Lancelot are almost as good.\n5) If you regularly make bagels, the stiff, low-hydration dough will overtax most home mixers. I have had good luck with the Swedish Ankarsrum which was able to\n6) The flour:water ratio varies according to flour type and humidity. For bagels, you want a smooth and elastic dough that is barely sticky. Adjust with small amounts of flour or water accordingly.\n7) Silicone mats work great and avoid any use of oil. For the overnight retard, simply cover the bagels with plastic wrap that will adhere to the mat around the bagels, forming a seal.\n8) I bake at 475\u00b0 with a stone on the bottom and a pan. I allow about 45 min to fully heat the stones and the oven. I pour boiling water into the pan just before closing the oven door.",
				"Can active dry yeast be used instead of instant yeast?",
				"Wow! Nice Bagels. one of my favorite dish. Will try it soon.",
				"I have been looking at many bagel recipes and a few people have used brown sugar instead of the malt barley. What is your thought on this? Will it give a different flavor? Not taste like a real bagel should?",
				"I had all but given up on having great bagels, after moving away from North Jersey 25 years ago.  These are the best I have EVER had.",
				"These came out beautifully, in spite of some discrepancies on my part: I had no bread flour so had to use AP;, and my husband didn&#8217;t hear me tell him to turn the oven down before popping them in, so they baked the whole time at 500. Still they were chewy and crunchy and tender and dark golden brown and couldn&#8217;t be better.\nI was a bit worried because the dough seemed so dry to work with, but your reassurance about the percentage of hydration helped, and I took a leap of faith. This will be on my regular go-to list of recipes forever! Thanks.",
				"Hi again, well as you may have guessed my next batch came out exactly as you\u2019ve experienced with a wetter dough\u2014-FLAT!  They did puff up nicely in the fridge but were impossible to handle &amp; will be like bagel chips once cut.  Thanks so much for your time on the recipe &amp; your responses.",
				"Hi Eva, thanks for the really quick reply\u2014just wish I had read it before starting my next batch!  I\u2019ve tried weighing my ingredients when making pizza dough but even though I have a high quality scale it never seems to come out right either., at least when I use grams.  I\u2019m using King Arthur Bread Flour but did NOT do as you suggested &amp; whisk it first.  I wound up having to add more than 1 additional cup of water (added a little more barley syrup along with it).  Even with having to change on the fly, the bagels still came out very close to the bagels I used to get on Long Island in terms of texture, size &amp; flavor &amp; definitely so much batter than any supposed \u2018NY bagel\u2019 I can get here near Tampa.  Everyone wolfed them down &amp; even passed over my raisin bread in favor of these bagels!  Thanks again.",
				"Now I\u2019m having the opposite problem\u2014going strictly by the recipe, 1 1/3 c water is not nearly enough.  I came across your recipe searching for a bagel recipe like the bagels I used to get when I lived on Long Island.  Once I added about 1/2 c or more of water the dough was better but still seemed too dry. I thinks \u2018savs\u2019 comment from Dec. 29 hits it about right, though even with dough that wasn\u2019t nearly hydrated enough these turned out as close to the bagels I was looking for as I\u2019ve found since moving to FL.  It was so hard to resist not eating a hot onion bagel when they were done at 9pm, simply not fair.",
				"I\u2019m an amateur baker and I\u2019ve been making Peter Reinhart\u2019s bagels from \u201cThe Bread Baker\u2019s Apprentice\u201d for about 2 years and have always had mixed results, mostly because of the bagels flattening out. They always tasted ok but we\u2019re never the right shape.  I was so excited to read your explanation on hydration in the recipe as it answered that question, I\u2019ve done this recipe twice now and they\u2019ve been more consistent. My one problem is getting the toppings to stick to the bagel. I use both malt and baking soda in the poaching liquid, but once they\u2019re through baking, and light handling to slice them, knocks 85% of the toppings off. I put on poppy seeds, sesame seeds, salt, onion, and garlic.",
				"The right way to make it is use soggy bagel dough and let rest for two days in the frig. It&#8217;s the two day bagel whe dough needs to mature to taste like a classic bagel. I never flour the table I want the dough wet unlike pizza dough which I throw into the AP flour to roll out. For bagels you roll the dough into balls and then cylinders to length then connect the ends into a loop. Then put three fingers into the hole roll once back and forth to meld the seam together. Place into a pot of boiling water boil on both sides 45 seconds to 1 min. They must float upto the surface or they won&#8217;t be airy after baking. Then place on wooden plakes to dry off one side then place them on to it&#8217;s other side on sheet pans till golden. These steps don&#8217;t include the sprinkle toppings such seasame , garlic etc. Cut and smear on some cream cheese or butter. You should hear the crunch when you bite down and the inside should be airy and moist. I may have missed a few things but keep looking.",
				"I was going to make these today until I read the recipe. Your time does not account for the 1 hour of rising&#8230;I&#8217;ll make them tomorrow \ud83d\ude42",
				"This recipe looks great but there is way too much water in the dough. As is the dough becomes very soupy! Perhaps a typo?"

				"Am making these with green grapes.I did not have red wine vinegar, so am using apple cider vinegar and champagne vinegar and a little umi plum vinegar . Used white sugar and brown and honey. I also added some coriander seeds and a tiny sprig of rosemary. I must say that the pickling liquor smells delicious!",

Anyway, I baked them and for the first time trying pretzel buns at least they turned out brown!! And good taste as well, but definitely gonna try it again! Thanks for so many amazing recipes, so far the tahini cookies and apples and blueberries crumble muffins are my favorites!!!!! Love your blog xxx",

The dough ended up very dense and I could not integrate all the flour, please tell me what I did wrong I&#8217;m super excited to try it again, kisses!",
				"These look great! I&#8217;ve been wanting to get into baking breads but I&#8217;ve actually never made any before, or I think I tried once and it didn&#8217;t work out because the yeast was too old or something! I should probably learn more about this whole baking chemistry thing, hahah&#8230;instead of just throwing a bunch of stuff together and hoping it works it out. That leads to A LOT of failed recipes. I&#8217;m not gluten-free but I don&#8217;t eat much, however for some reason making my own bread just sounds better than going store-bought. Totally healthier, right?! \ud83d\ude09 I&#8217;ll let you know if I can successfully make these&#8230;.the instructions are very clear so I should be good to go! Thanks!"
