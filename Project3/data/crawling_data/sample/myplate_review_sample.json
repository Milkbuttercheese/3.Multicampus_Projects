I can't understand anyone wanting to add more flour ... they must like eating bricks.  I go for moist food, myself. :-)",

				"I used this recipe as inspiration when working with my son's co-op preschool class.  We do cooking activities once a week and we set up a make-your-own  pizza station which was a huge hit with our group of 4 and 5 year olds.  In addition to the toppings listed, we had a bowl of olives, chopped ham, pineapple, and green peppers.  It was fun to see kids varying opinions about things like black olives and green peppers- some of them loved them, some said \"yuck!\" at first but then were willing to try (and even liked!) these foods once their friends ate them.  We used whole wheat English Muffins, and also baked in the oven (about 10 minutes at 400) vs. a toaster as we do not have toaster ovens at the school.  A large (commercial sized) sheet pan worked perfectly for about 18 pizzas.  Two household sized cookie sheets would probably work for the same amount.  We put them on parchment paper so that we could write names by each pizza so each student could be sure to get the one they made.  Lots of positive comments made and several parents and students mentioned that they were definitely going to make these at home."

It will add a touch of protein and color and make it suitable for breakfast too!"

Also, the (non-Asian) peanuts are a problem for many people.  To make the salad safer, more interesting and tasty (and a bit Asian), we substituted cashew nuts for peanuts and added a bit of ground ginger to the salad dressing.  With those variations, the salad was popular.  It is certainly simple to make and offers a nice balance of fruit, veggies and protein.  P.S.  I hope someone will correct the typos in the recipe."
