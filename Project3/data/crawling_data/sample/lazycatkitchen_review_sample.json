				"I've made this dish twice now in a little over a week - it is courgette season after all! The first time I forgot to get some tofu out of the freezer and so used cashews, the second time I remembered the tofu. As ever with a recipe there were minor changes - I had no capers and I was vaguely halving it for two. But both times the resulting meal was delicious. It is a great way of using a lot of courgette in one dish without it being too \"courgettey\". And if you have any of the filling left over and there is still space in the pan going in the oven,  just form balls of mixture and put them in alongside the rolled courgettes. We'll be certainly cooking this one again, at least once more before our courgettes run out.",
				"Reading your recipe, and it sounds amazing! The tofu filling rather positively surprised me, I couldn't think of that myself! Going to make this tomorrow and make a separate slightly change to the recipe for my baby (we are trying to feed him almost the same things as us). I'll let you know how it went! Thanks again, been following your blog throughout the years and several stages life gives me. Student, working, pregnant, baby!"

I used the 2nd method of keeping the milk at a constant temperature of 85\u00b0C. I used a Thermomix because it tells me the exact temperature in the pot. I'll try the 1st method next time and will rest the milk + curds.Anyway, it turned into a delicious cream cheese and I can see how versatile it is! Genius idea :)",

This recipe was one of the best veggie ones I've ever made and the slaw with dressing was a complete and delightful surprise. Must admit to cheating and just using a tub of shop bought guacamole but it was still nice. I also used pouches of spanish grains from the supermarket rather than plain brown rice. I used the 'What the Cluck' chicken substitute and cooked it how Ania suggested and it turned out just perfect. Think this is going to be one of my most used recipes from now on.",

I had to leave it in the freezer for 4 hours and was worried it would be too hard to eat right away, but the chocolate layer was still soft/melty (I liked it though - was like a mix between cheesecake and ice cream). I was a bit confused about step 3 around leaving some in the blender, so I just poured out what easily poured out into the chocolate bowl and didn't scrape the blender out before putting in the vanilla ingredients. My blender did have a hard time starting up again since there's not much liquid for that part, so now I know to leave more in there next time!",

I always end up seizing my chocolate when I melt it on the stove, so I microwaved the chocolate and then mixed in the coffee granules and blended cashew cream. They took way longer than 3 hours to freeze (after 5 hours the chocolate layer was still soft, so I froze them over night before cutting them.) They are rich and have the delicious flavor of tiramisu, but are pretty easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!"

I don\u2019t think the lemon grass I bought was very good, it was stringy/tough all the way through (would love to know what it should\u2019ve looked like after bashing!) but by chance I had a tube of lemongrass pur\u00e9e that I bought last year, so added that instead.

				"The flavour of this mousse is ON POINT!I was so excited when I saw this recipe come into my emails...:) I love lemony sweets, as I love that sweet, sour, tang combo. Anyway.. I realised I didn't have enough cashews left, but I did have silken tofu in the fridge... so I thought Id try it with that... I also usually always want to stick to unrefined sugars, but because I was going to be subbing a major ingredient (cashews for tofu), I decided to use the cheaper caster sugar instead of coconut sugar  just incase it didn't work out!I wasn't really concentrating making this... so I'm not sure if I was supposed to allow the syrup mixture to reduce and thicken..? So, mine was basically complete liquid, just with the sugar dissolved.I mixed it with the tofu, and at first put the same amount of tofu in as it would have been cashews... But I felt it was super runny... so I ended up putting in 300g of tofu (the full packet). Note; as I said, I really wasn't concentrating properly making this!Anyway... the flavour was awesome... so I continued... Whipped the aquafaba to stiff peaks, started combining the tofu lemon mix with the aquafaba, and I was expecting it to just deflafe... But it actually seemed like it was keeping its form! So I put the mix in moulds and put it in the fridge to set overnight. The next morning, the mousse looked amazing..and looked like it had set...and it had, but just at the very bottom, liquid was beginning to separate... But, the top two thirds of the pots, were beautifully lemony, light, tangy, sweet delicious! I think... considering my complete lack of concentration making these.. this might be a pretty fool proof recipe, and I can't wait to make it with cashews...or perhaps reduce the syrup more so it is thicker, and try again with tofu (more cost effective)... Thank you Ania, once again for another beautiful recipe!! X"

				"The absolute BEST recipe!I have made this recipe a couple of times now, its time consuming but not particularly difficult as all the steps are explained really clearly. The pastry is crisp, the lemon curd is tart and tangy and the aquafaba meringue is fluffy on the outside with a crisp shell. I took it to a party and it was proclaimed by an omnivore to be the best LMP she'd ever eaten, so i think that is an absolute WIN!I am considering just making the lemon curd on its own (with a tad less cornflour so its a little softer) for spreading on cakes, its really delicious and would be lovely in a sponge (or on toast!)You will not regret making this, treat yourself!",

I really appreciate your detailed instructions and attention to detail, the recipe came together so smoothly and I cannot wait to make it again. Thanks Ania!",
				"Im currently making this now, and will do the meringue tomorrow... Im following recipe as is this time.... and Ive given it 5 stars, cos your recipes are always a winner! Buttt, I would love to know your thoughts on adapting it to make it refined sugar free... I have tried adding ground coconut sugar to whipped aquafaba already, but it deflates so much... though I did use it for your ladyfingers, for the tiramisu, and it didn't effect the end result of the biscuits... but I think for this, it would be a no go to sub the castor sugar for the meringue bit, but what about for the lemon filling? Any ideas? Anyway, excited to see how this turns out,  you were reading my mind by working on lemon meringue! Thank you, as always for your hard work that goes into all these delicious recipe creations! X",

It was quite sticky to roll into balls with my hands.. but the batter is so yummy, so I could easily clean my hands!! \ud83d\ude0bI missed the step of baking one tray at a time,  so baked both trays at the same time.

Rather than a mild olive oil I used a stronger one as I live in Spain and have access to truly amazing oil.

I used 4 black bananas (they were on the brink of spoiling), a couple tablespoons of leftover icing from Christmas that was still in the fridge somehow and some almond butter that has completely separated into almond oil and rock hard almond solids. It came out really well!One thing I am wondering about is whether 1 c flour really is 125 g? It seemed very little when I was adding it to the rest of the batter so I added a bit more. I was making the batter in a Thermomix and weighting everything is easier for me.",
				"These were amazing! I had one warm and one as soon as it had cooled down. They were so light and fluffy. I only had around 375g of banana \ud83d\ude05 so I added a little bit more peanut butter and they were still soo good. Your recipes are the best. Please don't ever give up your day job \ud83e\udd29",

I added some chopped walnuts, also my peanut butter wasn't 'drippy' so I warmed it lightly with the maple syrup in a pan.",

				"Fantastic recipe! I didn\u2019t have the porcini so I used a little white miso+water for umami & so skipped the soy sauce on the step adding the broth & sauce (still used the soy to season the shrooms before baking) Next time, if not using the porcini mushrooms, I\u2019\u2019ll definitely up the amount of oyster- or maybe add some cremini or shiitake- just so the finished product is super full of mushroom-y goodness. Will definitely make again- thank you!",

				"Perfect recipe! I was worried the pancakes would be hard to flip and that I'd make a big mess of them but they work SO well and are so easy to do. (I use a cast iron crepe pan with a very flat surface and low sides). I've been making this recipe almost weekly since I tried it. When I'm entertaining or just want an easier dinner-prep, I make the pancakes earlier in the day and they hold up well. I add both onion and spinach to the potatoes for flavor and a healthy dose of greens.",
				"Just made this, it was fab! I threw some leftover flax egg I had in the fridge into the batter which didn't seem to do any harm (cut back a bit on water and chickpea flour to compensate), and used some coconut cream with lime instead of yogurt for topping, and our best home made tomato chutney. From these quantities I got six pancakes in a 20 cm pan, they were quite thick and substantial, I think I could have gone got more if I'd gone a bit thinner with the batter but I was nervous they'd break up. I'd quite like to make small ones in the little blini pan next time but they do take a long time to cook compared to normal pancakes. Anyway, they were delicious, and the masala potatoes were too, and very easy. Spinach in with those sounds a good idea. I didn't put anything into the pancake mix except salt and a little black pepper, and it was just as well, as my husband was eyeing up second helpings and asked if he could have a small one for dessert. We had them with local Brittany buckwheat honey - which we have no objection to eating as we're not strict vegans, but I'm sure maple syrup or other vegan options would be great too - and the rest of the coconut lime cream and they were just as good sweet as savoury!I've not been following your blog very long and find it a great discovery and very inspiring, thank you!",
				"This was delicious! The cashew cream went really well with it and with chutney & cilantro it was so good! I had to stop myself from eating way too much. Awesome recipe! Thank you!  it took more than half an hour to cook all the pancakes, one by one, though. I think I got at least 10 of the 1/4 cup pancakes!",
				"So yummy!    I\u2019m glad I took the time to precook and cool the potatoes; the crispy bits were just extra deliciousness. Added spinach with garbanzo beans on the side with the same spices but it would have been a complete meal without it. The pancakes were easy and delicious!",
				"This is an incredible and super tasty meal! The lentil pancakes are flavorful and easy to make. Delicious with the potatoes and all the fixings. A must try! Wholesome, filling and flavorful meal. You will be transformed. Such a tasty recipe! Thank you, Ania!",
				"This is a wonderfully satisfying and delicious dish. The pancakes have an incredible flavour and I can see them becoming a staple in our household. What I also like is that it is such a cheap and filling meal yet really nourishing esp if you can toss in a bit of spinach to wilt with the potatoes. A great hit! Totally love Your recipes.

I'm not sure how tender the cabbage leaves are supposed to be once they're fully cooked in the oven, or whether the rolls are supposed to hold together in one piece when you cut them--I found them just a little troublesome to cut cleanly with a knife. Very very tasty, though! I used brown rice for the filling (cooked before adding to the filling) and it worked really well.",

In my opinion a plate of neatly rolled cabbage rolls in tomato sauce does not look any worse than some pasta dish and far more appealing than lasagna :)!

My Ukrainian granny made them naturally plant-based with potatoes and buckwheat, shredded potatoes, rice, buckwheat and veggies and so on.

				"I just tried these (whipped aquafaba method), and they completely collapsed in the oven into a flat mess. Any idea where we went wrong? They taste good though. The only difference from the recipe  is that the pistachios were nubbly and not entirely finely ground - we only had whole ones and don't have a coffee grinder so just bashed them up as much as we could. Don't know if that would have made them collapse, or if we maybe over-mixed the dough after putting in the aquafaba? Thanks!",

This looks amazing, but I have a question - it\u2019s my understanding that in ordering to get the benefits of miso\u2019s probiotic enzyme nutrients (for gut micro biome health) it should not be heated beyond 115F, as anything higher kills those probiotics.  Of course if it\u2019s just added to enhance flavour and not for the nutrient benefit, that\u2019s a different story! I\u2019m a nutrition nut from Victoria, BC Canada, 77 yrs old, vegan for 4 1/2 yrs, and LOVING it!  Feel SO blessed to be in this age when any recipe in the world is at my fingertips!

				"Lovely recipe, so easy to make (I didn't bother piping the biscuits, used a spoon instead - they came out a little messy but still delish) and the result is sublime. My dinner party guests raved about it!",
				"Ania, thank you so much for this AMAZING recipe! I made the whole thing including your sponge fingers and the result surpassed my expectations. It took some time but then that's to be expected with a dessert like this. The flavor and texture were beautiful and even my non-vegan guests were mightily impressed. Thank you!!! Amanda",
				"This dessert was perfection, Ania! I could not believe how good it was and my vegetarian husband went back to seconds. It took a while to make but that's to be expected given having to make vegan sponge fingers from scratch - they were great btw, I will leave another review too. Thank you for all your amazing recipes, we love you blog and they really make a big difference to our lives. Helen",

				"OMG! Cooked this for my wife on Valentine's Day and it was the star of the show. Easy to make and delicious!!",

				"Yay yipee yay! I made half the cream mixture recipe and full ladyfinger recipe (but only used half of the actual ladyfingers)  to make 5 mini tiramisu pots! What a (another!!) winner of a recipe Ania! Yes i agree that the ladyfingers could be soaked more than briefly, so I just soaked them a bit longer but took them out before they could crumble or disintergrate!I used the softened dates instead of icing sugar, and although it changes the colour of the \"cream\", it is still absolutely delicious! I also used coconut sugar in the ladyfingers instead of caster sugar, and they turned out great -I ground the sugar first to make it finer... Thank you once again for an epic recipe! Aim\u00e9e",
				"Okay, SO. This is my second time making a vegan tiramisu recipe--the first time (with a different recipe), I was really unsatisfied with. For the sake of others learning from my experience should they encounter similar difficulties, I'll be somewhat detailed here.First, the ladyfingers! I don't know if I added too much flour (I measured by volume and not weight, rookie mistake), but the dough came out very dry--I added a little bit of almond milk, but it was still more like a sugar cookie dough than anything you could pipe, and I was wary of overmixing by adding more and more liquid. So I ended up shaping the dough with my fingers into cylinders and pressing them down, which surprisingly seemed to work fine, and they came out pretty much perfect. The mascarpone was really tasty, and the filtered coconut oil worked great (I used Thrive Market's)--no coconut taste whatsoever. I wonder if, because the original is technically a cheese, it could use something to create a slight tang, like lemon juice. Overall though I'm pretty happy with it!According to my Italian mother, the ladyfingers are supposed to get rather soggy in the coffee mixture. I think the taste of coffee in the final product could have been stronger, myself. The cookies were certainly crisp enough to withstand longer soaking, but I wanted to follow instructions and only briefly submerged them. Do with this information what you will!Very excited to have had success with this recipe. Thank you!!",
				"Hi! So I tried making the ladyfingers again yesterday (my mom actually requested that I do!), and made sure to measure everything by weight. I still seemed to have ended up with a very stiff dough--I wonder if my aquafaba sitting in the fridge for a week or two beforehand could have contributed to it? For the sake of transparency, I want to note that I used tapioca starch instead of corn or potato, and instead of a tsp of lemon juice in the aquafaba, I used 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar. These seem like very small adjustments on the surface to me, so I'm unsure they should really affect the dough much, but I'm admittedly an amateur so who knows. Same as last time, I ended up shaping them with my fingers. They still turned out fine! Totally useable in another tiramisu recipe. Not sure what I'm doing incorrectly, though.",
				"Hi! I saw in a comment below that you said using vegan cream cheese is possible to replace the silken tofu (not that I'm worried about the tofu--just that I like the idea of using cream cheese!). How much would you recommend using in the recipe?Also! Most tiramisu recipes I find usually call for a layer of whipped cream as the final layer (as opposed to just layering with mascarpone). I'm curious, is there a reason you decided not to do this in your recipe? Do you think adding it could be a good idea?Thank you in advance for your help!",
				"Really tasty end result but it definitely took a lot longer than 30mins to make. A couple of things about the recipe were confusing. 350g silken tofu - is this the weight straight out of the packet or after it's drained? I also typically press tofu otherwise it's too watery, which is what I did here, meaning I added much more than 350g as the tofu lost about 20% of its weight after being pressed. The cream also wasn't terribly sweet and just tasted like cashews so I added more sugar (probably x2 the amount) and also some lemon juice. I found the part about agar agar confusing. I used agar agar powder but it would have been good as a first timer to include specific agar agar instructions in the recipe - ie it needs to be boiled in order to be activated and straight after boiling it add it to the cream mixture and blend. The agar agar packet said to put in the fridge so that's what I did at first. Also the hyperlink for refined coconut oil goes to a page for unrefined coconut oil which the recipe says results in too much of a coconut taste. I'm really glad my partner helped or I would have thrown the towel in. I was very relieved it turned out well and my friends loved it.",
				"Hi Ania. Thanks so much for your reply.My answers as follows1) I definitely used silken tofu. I went to an Asian supermarket to be sure I had the widest variety available to choose from. It was very fragile but definitely very watery. 2) I used your lady fingers recipe :) they were great.3) I used the Golden Trophy brand agar agar, made in Thailand, as that seemed to be the best rated brand.",
				"What a beauty this dessert was!! I made it for Christmas Day and everyone was ooing and ahhing over it. It was beautiful (I made your sponge fingers also) and I will certainly be tempted to make it outside of Christmas too. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe. Sophie",
				"Happy New Year Ania! I made this for new years eve and it was phenomenal. My partner is Italian so he is a keen judge of these things! I must add a piping bag to my kitchen equipment list though, trying to improvise with cling film was a fairly messy endeavour! Thanks for including the tip on the mixing bowl being spotlessly clean - I think last time I tried whipping aquafaba that got me - worked perfectly this time though!",
				"Truly georgeous. I made your lady finger bics for base, but mine were long blobs as cant be bothered to pipe a biscuit. I halved recipe but made full coffee/alcohol amount by mistake and ended u using 2/3 of it. Did the agar method for thickening.  I had also made some speculoos spice blend and then forgot what i intended to do with it so put half a teaspoon in cream.  Was amazing and will be a staple for special occasions. Thanks x",
				"Hi Ania! This recipe looks so yummy!! Planning to make it for New Years Eve this year. I have a question\u2026 Can the cream be made ahead, the day before or will it set too much to spread it? Talking about the version with agar agar. Thanks x",
				"Hi thereIs 5 teaspoons agar agar powder correct? I was wondering if it should be 5 grams?Thank you!",

Probably my gluten free mix works a bit differently than the one you use, how would you solve this problem? Thank you!",
				"Hey Ania,They came out super nice. Crunchier than expected as the color was still very light, but perfect for tiramisu. I can't wait to eat the tiramisu tomorrow! Definitely a very good recipe, five stars from me!I have one question though. Regular ladyfingers with eggs would require way more aquafaba (probably almost double) for the amount of flour/cornstarch you use. I assume you tried this and it didn't work out? Because the texture is very different from non-vegan ladyfingers, just was curious.",
				"Who doesn\u2019t love a Tiramisu. The recipe I have used in the past states to bake a cake then cut it and dry it out, like biscotti, so when I saw this recipe I was very excited. The ingredients are things you would normally have in your cupboard, so I didn\u2019t even have to venture out and pluck the red flower from the highest mountain top in Peru - although that would be an experience in itself! The recipe is very well written and comes together exactly as indicated. I needed help with the piping as I didn\u2019t have a big enough nozzle and the dough is very thick. My suggestion is to get a large nozzle. My husband ended up adapting a nozzle I never use to be bigger, and those biscuits came out very pretty. Oven temperature- this depends a bit more on your oven, if you are a baker and you know your oven then adjust to how you normally bake biscuits, my first batch I made exactly as written and they came out a bit overdone, so on the second batch I lowered the temp a bit and they were perfect. They don\u2019t take long to make either, the longest part is whipping the aquafaba (chickpea water) and the baking\u2026 These biscuits are delicious on their own too with tea, so if you don\u2019t want tiramisu then bake them because you can. I think they will work really well for a trifle too! What are you waiting for? Go on, you know you want to!",
				"Hi Ania,I made the biscuits a few weeks back and they came out beautifully. Then used them for your tiramisu recipe. Everything got wiped out clean in no time. Thank you so much for all the efforts you put in to make these perfect recipes. Love from India. \u2764\ufe0f",

I tried yesterday and messed up because the psyllium husk powder turned into a gelatinous mass before I added it to the flour.

				"AMAZING. Talk about FRESH. Honestly making this was a joy. The smell of the ripe tomatoes coming off the vine to the smell of them roasting is nothing short of intoxicating. I used a walnut ricotta but am looking forward to seeing your almond ricotta recipe! Excited to try a new version of the ones weve been trying for years. Dinner was a complete success, ready for it to be lunch tomorrow so I can enjoy the leftovers.... maybe breakfast.... :p"

				"Hey Ania, Mine have just come out the oven...smell divine! I baked them in two goes, so the first I just put a spoonful of the batter and left a lot of room around incase they spread - but though they look great -rustic - they havent acheived that round cookie shape like yours... So the second lot, I pressed them down to more of a round cookie shape... Which did you do? The second batch also looks cool but dont seem to have those beautif cracks like yours ..Can't wait to eat one just now! X",

				"DELISH. What a fun treat. As a woman married to someone lactose intolerant it is always an adventure to find desserts that still taste like a dessert! This one nailed it. While I usually make the sweet potato cake by Lazy Cat Kitchen I thought I would try this new recipe. I am thinking we will need to have both from here on out. They were gone in 2.5 days. (ps.  i used egg whites and they turned out fab)",

My daughter followed her nose into the kitchen and ate two before they had time to cool.  She loved them, the outside was crisp and the inside was fudgey like a brownie.  My husband and I had two each before they disappeared.  I will definitely be making them again, and again, and again.",

				"SO good! I actually charred my broccolini in the same pan as my corn (cooked my marinated tofu in that pan, too), which added a lovely flavor element to the final dish, and I blitzed the mushrooms in with the broth rather than fish them out. The finished broth was wonderfully complex and had the perfect kiss of heat (I used one Serrano in with the aromatics). Delightful ramen!",

				"Hi Ania, Thanks for another super recipe!I was needing white chocolate for an Entremet experiment and could not find the appropriate vegan version locally. So I decided to try and make yours once I finally managed to find some unadulterated coconut milk powder (which was also a mission to find)!  Your recipe worked beautifully! I made my own cashew nut butter and as the coconut powder was ludicrously expensive, I decided to try and use all other additional required ingredients as wholesome as possible. So I made my own confectioners sugar from organic coconut blossom too. The end result was a beautiful salted caramel type chocolate that has held extremely well , even out of the fridge. I use a very strong sea salt, so over flavoured it with that a bit much but the chocolate was really good, if not quite the 'white' chocolate I had set out to do! I have not tried it in baking yet. Maybe I will make a batch of chocolate chip cookies and add some to that to see how it fairs. Fortunately I have now found a chocolatier who is making white chocolate for me for my entremet experiment, so I can just enjoy eating the one I made from your recipe on its own!",

I have been distracting myself so much recently on my phone with mindless watching and scrolling and it is so self destructive to my state of mind.I suffer, in stages, with anxiety, and have found Himalaya's Geriforte tablets (a mix of natural Ayurvedic adaptogenic herbs-including Ashwaghanda) to really help - start for 1 week taking 2 tablets first thing on a morning and 2 tablets last thing at night... Thereafter, you can drop to 1 tablet am and pm... I really have found that they help me, and they work for your bodys needs (adapt-ogens)...I hope your anxiety gets better...its a horrible thing. Xx"

Would I be able to grill the frozen sweetcorn and use that? What quantity do you reckon I'd need?

				"Hands down the best vegan cheesecake recipe I\u2019ve ever tried - I\u2019ve made it twice in the past 2 weeks - once for a coeliac-friendly meal with friends and yesterday with tweaks as the dessert for a friend\u2019s birthday.  It\u2019s gone straight into my top 5 vegan desserts of all time.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe xx",
				"I\u2019ve been trying to find the perfect No bake vegan cheesecake for ages and at last I have found it!  I made it gluten-free for a coeliac too and it\u2019s absolutely brilliant - thanks for such a fantastic recipe \u2764\ufe0f",
				"Have you tried substituting the cashews for more tofu instead? Cashews are a little pricey where I live.",
				"I just love this recipe. It is easy and the cheesecake is so creamy. I have made it several times with different cookies and different toppings. They were all so delicious! Thank you for sharing.",
				"Hello I really want to try this but am in Italy and haven\u2019t found silken tofu as yet just normal natural? Will it work with the natural or should I curb my impatience and wait till I am back in the UKwhere I know I can find silken! Hope you are well and thanks for your wonderful offerings x",
				"Have you tried looking in  Asian supermarkets? They always carry silken tofu.",
				"What is a ginger biscuit? What brand would I buy in the US? Thx",
				"I love the simplicity of this cheesecake and the creaminess is out of this world, no one could tell it was vegan and it was all gone too soon, no leftovers at all. thank you for another great recipe! Zoe",
				"How many people is this intended to serve - nutritional info is per serving. Thanks.",
				"The consistency was a bit disappointing: it looked like cheesecake but 'felt' like tiramisu. I followed your recipe to the letter and let the cake rest for 24h instead of 4h. So that can't be it. I can't help but think: shouldn't I put some agar agar next time? Or arrowroot?",
				"Thanks a lot for the explanation, Ania. But I don't think it was the cocoa butter. Mine is really hard and opaque too, I think. Could it have been the tofu, I wonder. I let it drain really well though.Or maybe it's just not my taste? When it comes to no-bake cheesecake I'm used to (and really like) the consistency you get with gelatine. I guess that is not what I should expect when using cocoa butter? BUT! Serendipitously I found a solution. Last weekend I froze half of the cake because it was too much. Yesterday I took out a piece and left it at room temperature for one hour before eating it. The consistency was perfect for me that way! :)",
				"I made this using coconut oil instead of cocoa butter and it worked fine. I just used the same quantities by weight and it worked out great. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Is it possible to substitute cacao butter with something else? (not sure if I\u2019ll be able to find it easily)",
				"Thanks for the explanation. I made this yesterday and it was SO GOOD!! The ginger biscuits worked so well with the filling and made it a very interesting cake. Everyone that tried it thought it was delicious!",
				"This sounds delicious! I don\u2019t see white chocolate amongst the list of ingredients as mentioned in the comment above. Is this an error?",
				"What a fantastic texture this comes out as, looks absolutely amazing with the raspberry and strawberry topping! The hint of ginger is such a tasty pairing with the white chocolate.Enjoyed this one immensely. Now to negotiate over the remaining portions :)",
				"Will be making this soon i never had dairy free cheesecale before this is perfect for me as i dont like dairy cheesecake perfect for my home snacks while i work on the computer and phone  will dm you if i make this and let you know how it goes Thanks Ramya"

				"This was great. I am trying vegan dishes for the family now and this was a great success! Will be making it again and trying other recipes too! Thank you! x",
				"Didn\u2019t quite buy enough lemongrass but they were still amazing. Thank you for such a delicious recipe",
				"I have a massive aversion to aubergine / eggplant, is there anything you would recommend as a replacement. Most of it I think is physiological, but since its ,e making them, then that doesn\u2019t help.",
				"I'm very excited to make this, but I do think the prep or the cooking time should include the one hour chill period. I will prep the mixture tonight and make tomorrow given this situation.",

				"will  be making this soon  i never banh mi  and vietnamese food before  perfect for my office snacks will dm you if i make this  and let you know how it goes Thanks Ramya",
				"thank you for the recipe.as far as fleas: Diatomaceous earth - human grade is my recommendation.",
				"These look delicious! There\u2019s just two of us, so can I make a full batch of meatballs and freeze them? Also, I use lemongrass spice  drops, they\u2019re pretty good!"

Fantastic pictures and amazing dishes - I tried out many and always got something super tasty on my plate.So, please, please, please keep posting - if only for me ;)Any chances of a recipe for a vegan szarlotka? :) Thanks Ana",
				"sorry just saw this now will be making this soon i never had salad before perfect for my after office meals sorry i took a break from commenting  on your recipes as busy with work will dm you if make this and let you know how it goes Thanks Ramya",
				"PS I too love fennel. Have you tried it sliced up keeping base intact, saut\u00e9ed in oil till browned, 16 whole peeled garlic cloves added, a bit longer.. then 1 cup of veg stock and pepper.. bring to boil, cover simmer 15 minutes. Watch liquid levels. Then throw in a can of chopped tomatoes and boil vigorously to reduce a little. Parsley in quantities and vegan cheese to finish.. good on any carb including instant  polenta.",
				"Oh Ania! You need a Greek holiday!   It is good to understand what it is like to be a top notch internet siter and does sound like a treadmill from your description\u2026 I for one would be equally happy with photos of your new bathroom, WIP shots, or the lounge wall colour or your garden or the the eponymous lazy cat of great fame. We don\u2019t need a recipe all the time and you are not a machine. A picture is as good as a thousand words. Be gentle with yourself, you have much to be proud of! Xx"

				"Incredible!! I can\u2019t believe how simple ingredients can turn into such a deliciouse dish. Your recipes are so original and nutritional. I can\u2019t thank you enough for creating an amazing recipes. Since I found your blog, I no longer eat meat. What you do have helped animals. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Made this during Melbourne lockdown and it was bloody delicious! It was easy to make too, although it did take quite a bit of time - but all good things are worth waiting for! I would recommend making the filling and sauce  in advance and then doing the bechamel and assembly on the second night. 10/10  all the non vegans were very impressed too",

				"Delicious !  Had never made cashew cheese before and it was very straightforward .Banished forever are boring memories of spinach and ricotta when I was a vegetarian in the 90s !My teenage son scoffed his portion & asked for seconds !",
				"This recipe was our yesterday evening dinner and it was delicious. I liked the idea of cashews in the ricotta spinach filling because it has more protein. I had large shell pastas at home and this is what I used. I find it easier to fill in. I will definitely make this recipe again !",
				"Made this last night. Absolutely delicious! Thank you Ania for making our mealtimes really interesting.",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe.  I haven't made cannelloni for decades and it was refreshing to revisit.  The flavours are amazing and this is going to become a new  favourite in our household.  Definitely going to try it out on our non vegan friends. Yum!",
				"From the pictures, it looks like you're using dried and uncooked pasta. Did I understand correctly? If so, this is one of my favorite methods for a baked pasta; way less work and fewer dishes to clean afterward. Thank you for the recipe!"

				"Tonight I will make this lovely recipe. I made the Baked Gnocchi. The bomb! I am going to try the no-bake cheesecake in those lovely jarsyou have from Greece. I'll stemless wine glasses. Thanks for the fabulous ideas.",
				"I found this recipe to be good. I used vegetable broth I get from Trader Joe\u2019s. I also grabbed some canned artichokes but I do my best in getting those with the least or no preservatives. It does have a tad bit of acidity due to the citric acid but I balanced with the almond milk and vegetable broth. I also added some sun dried tomatoes and 2 extra cloves of garlic. As a true Caribe\u00f1a, we use lime more than lemon, so I used that and it was fine.",
				"I am having a hard time finding the yeast any suggestions?",
				"Many of the canned/jarred artichokes sold in the United States are packed in brine, which can be fairly acidic and sour. I love that you can find already-grilled artichokes packed in oil in the UK! I'll have to check some specialty stores near where I live. This recipe looks amazing!",
				"The artichokes itself was sour. The pasta sauce was beautiful!  I will try again with the same artichokes you used. \ud83d\ude0a",
				"I finally made this last night. It was my first time eating artichokes and I wasn\u2019t big fun of it haha it was a bit too sour for me but the rest was very nice as always!  Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Hello :) This dish looks so tasty! Can I please ask which brand of artichokes did you use? I couldn\u2019t find any around my neighborhood so I want to order online.  Thank you x",
				"Thank you for this recipe!  It's so delicious and easy to prepare!",
				"Have just made this tonight, it was such a lovely recipe thank you. I swapped the spaghetti for soybean spaghetti (GF) and it worked really well.",
				"So delicious even my husband ate it and there was no meat in it! haha he loved it too.",

				"Looks so fresh and lovely. thank you!",
				"I made the gluten free version as you suggested, it turned out great! Not too sweet, so you can really taste the strawberries. And the taste of buckwheat meal goes really well with it, I find. Thanks! After cooling down is it better to keep it in the fridge or at room temperature?",

We used what we had in the cupboard - tahini, sultanas, ground ginger & we did half ground flaxseeds/half chia seeds.Delicious with some natural yogurt and frozen blueberries & blackberries.I shall be making this for my niece who has dietary restrictions.",
				"This recipe is delicious, It has now become my go-to! I usually add a couple of tablespoons of vanilla protein powder to amp up the nutrition and make it just a tad sweeter. Thanks Ania!",
				"Dear Ania, thank you very much for the recipe. You perfected it to your usual high standard. I made granola for our trip to the Amazon and it turned out to be perfect. I added three dates chopped to bring a bit more sweetness as my bananas were not really ripe. And instead of ginger stems (that are hard to find in Brazil) I used a little bit of ginger powder to give it a little kick. And I also wanted to tell you how much I respect your work. All recipes that I have tried so far are of very high quality. I do realize how much work it is to perfect it to this level. Thank you for your work of bringing tasty healthy and environmentally friendly food to people.",
				"Hi, Is there a substitute for vanilla bean paste, it's too expensive?",
				"Great!",
				"This is delicious thank you! I avoid granola as I can't stop eating it straight from the jar- zero self control. Same issue with this recipe but not such a problem as there's no added sugar/oil ... Much better! It works so much better than I thought it might given they all are coated in sugar and oil.  Thank you for sharing!",
				"Oh this recipe seems great, I would love to try it as soon as I am back home. Quick question, if I understood it right, stem ginger is like candied ginger, right? The main difference is that one is dry, the other one is in a syrup?",
				"What is stem ginger?  Just chopped fresh ginger or the preserved ginger?   I\u2019ve never heard that term.",
				"This looks great. I don\u2019t eat granola with oil and sugar because I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop eating it either. What\u2019s the function of the baking soda. And can vanilla extract be used place of vanilla paste? Many thanks!"

				"I am starting to realize now that not all sugars are made equal...lol I will keep your  information in mind... oh, and maple butter is basically maple syrup mixed with some oil (think of a healthy oil) and it has marmalade like consistency that you can spread on anything from toasted bread to pancakes or waffles for breakfast  (similar to honey & butter mix)... I'm getting hungry as I type all this. Thanks, Ania!",
				"Hi Ania, yes the homegrown strawberries have so much flavour and you pick them at the peak ripeness when they are the sweetest and most fragrant! For the cookies, I used  \"maple sugar\" - it has almost powder-like consistency and it is made from maple syrup and it is even more expensive than the syrup. I live in Canada - the country of  everything Maple...lol so there is plenty of varieties of maple products - different grades maple syrup, maple candies, maple butters, maple sugar... I thought maple sugar will behave the same way as regular granulated sugar. I will try the cookies next time with the regular sugar (maybe coconut sugar). Thank you! :)",
				"Hi Ania, so it turned out mom did have tapioca starch and after the strawberry picking we made the dessert  at her place and in 2 doses - one with the 4 tsp tapioca per the recipe and one with only 1 tsp. I personally liked it creamier - the version with 1 tsp tapioca or maybe next  time I will just skip it altogether since I am all into moussy creamy consistency :)The biscuits turned ok an didn't  spread in the oven as others have noted. But I did use maple sugar as a sweetener (it melts better into the coconut oil), where the package says that it is twice as sweet as sugar, so I only  used half the recipe amount (1.5 Tbsp) but at the end they weren't  that sweet, so maybe next time I will  use the recipe amount (3 Tbsp). Also, it took longer than 30min for the biscuits to bake - maybe because they were cold from the fridge straight into the oven?!The final product was very yummy and a real treat after the strawberry picking! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"I  was wondering if I can use Xanthan Gum or Arrow root starch instead of Tapioca starch (only because I don't have any tapioca at the moment)? Going strawberry picking tomorrow and decided to try your recipe :)",
				"Hiya, Okay so  I made these last night - and despite my blender exploding everywhere (it's time; I have to face the fact to buy a new one! ) - they were delish! I didn't have any fresh strawberries so I stewed some apples with cinnamon, cardamom and date caramel and tossed some fresh raspberries in there. I also skipped the tofu and did a mixture of your previous cheesecake jar recipes and just used cashews , coconut cream and added the tapioca.Now, the shortbread are delish! I made 2 batches in 2 days! But, I had a bit of a problem with th first batch's batter consistency- it was very wet.. I used coconut oil and I think it may have been too runny as opposed the softened coconut oil as mentioned in the recipe? So I ended up adding quite a bit more GF flour so that I could handle it.I chilled them for a bit (less than 30mins) and popped them in the oven... Unfortunately they spread out a lot and I thought it was maybe because I hadn't chilled them properly. I ate them all in any case - because - still delicious!!The following day and 2nd batch I made sure my coconut oil wasn't so melted and the batter definitely seemed as it should be..So I popped the rolled biscuits to chill a full 30 mins or more.But they spread even more jn the oven than the other ones... Do you have any idea where I may have gone wrong?- I did use coconut sugar.- I also chilled the prebaked biscuits on the tray I used to bake them on..could it be that?I mean either way, they are absolutely delicious (did I mention that already!!) And have that perfect mouth watering crunch and moreishness of shortbread...hemce why I thought Id give a 3rd day of testing them a miss... ;)Thank you once again for another smashing recipe! Xx",
				"This looks amazing! I am in Australian and, strangely, winter is out best season for strawberries. Which is great because it is winter right now! Also excited to see that the cheesecake layer does not have coconut oil or coconut cream in it, and that the shortbread can be made with vegan butter. My coconut fat intolerant self thanks you!",
				"500 g is closer to 1 lb. Could you clarify which is correct? I know this isn\u2019t a very \u201cmeasured\u2019 part of the recipe, but I\u2019m sure the ratio of strawberries to cheesecake also makes a difference! Many thanks. Can\u2019t wait to try this one!",
				"Oh dear, I'm afraid I've got to diagnose myself with a hopelessly uncontrollable case of mouth-watering now...",

				"I have this a try as I had so much beetroot growing in the garden. It\u2019s a lovely recipe, especially if you love chocolate cake but don\u2019t want something sickly or overly sweet. The earthy tone of beetroot offsets the sweetness of the cocoa. And the ganache is really gorgeous. I think I put too much coconut milk in mine, so added two tablespoons of icing sugar to thicken it- it was perfect. The cake was so soft and moist, will definitely use this recipe again.",
				"I had grown some beetroot and it was my dad's birthday so decided to give this a go. It was delicious.  Really easy to follow and a nice looking, tasty cake. It's quite an 'adult'/sophisticated cake rather than one for a children's party. Good earthy undertones that stop it being too sweet. Nice and moist.  Lovely!",

I highly recommend this! Thank you so much Ania once again for a fab recipe! On point! I did tag you in my Insta, so you could see my results but not sure if it appeared your side... You must be proud of this one!Thank you! X",
				"This cake is amazing. Moist, rich, super chocolatey but not too sweet. I used olive oil and fine spelt flour and it turned out great.

I can't make a direct comparison to the original though since this was my first time making it. + I used canned beets and (light) olive oil. + Instead of sifting and mixing it in batches, I just added everything to the stand mixer and mixed it on low until it was mostly smooth. + I used a square cake pan (I think 8x8?)  and baked it for about half the time. + I made the ganache, but used almond milk instead of coconut milk.",
				"How wonderful you were able to fix the oven yourselves! The cake looks delicious! I\u2019m going to try making it next weekend.",
				"The beetroot chocolate cake was a great success. I grated the beetroot with my food processor and mixed all the other ingredients in there too. Very quick and easy!I left the chocolate ganache off because I felt it would be too rich. I happened to have some cooked raspberries with a bit of sugar which went very well with it.",
				"Would I be able to use cooked beetroot instead of raw in the recipe?",
				"So good! I used chocolate oat milk  for the plant milk and added  a handful of mini chocolate chips. I had  cooked beets and proceeded as written, worked. I frosted with  a vegan buttercream with almond extract and  an tablespoon of  sprinkles. I tripled the recouped and made three 11 by 7  sheet cakes, one for the day and the rest  for our freezer. My sons declared \u201c this tastes like an excellent birthday cake!\u201d",
				"Well done you two for trying to \u00e1nd fixing the oven! This cake is next on my baking list, as I have beetroots in the fridge, we love chocolate cake and the weather is horrible here in Belgium today as well (and grey, dark, windy and wet weather surely does affect my mood). We were on holiday last week (also in Belgium) and unfortunately it rained every single day... but not the whole day, and occasionally from time to time the sun came out (so I guess we were lucky!).",
				"Will be making this soon i love chocolate soooooooooooooo much i never had chocolate beetroot cake before perfect for my birthday on 19 September and after office snacks Will dm you if i make this and let you knoW hoW it goes Thanks Ramya"

I baked it for 37 minutes and I was so pleased to see the pastry turning almost completely golden brown by the thirtieth minute. The taste was also very delicious as I could feel the spinach taste in my mouth.

				"Thank you, Ania, for these amazing morsels!Made these as part of a picnic meal when it was too hot to cook. I didn't have rice flour so used about half to 3-quarters of the amount of cornflour which worked well. And I used a tin of chickpeas, drained well. I didn't have any seeds and I baked them on paper with no oil and they worked perfectly, crisp on the outside and lovely and moist on the inside. Full of flavour and a beautiful colour. Even my beetroot doubting son raved about these as the flavour is spicy rather than earthy, but the sweetness of the beetroot is a lovely addition. We'll be making these again, simple and delicious and so much better than standard dry and crumbly falafels of any description! My only niggle is that my food processor bowl couldn't cope with the volume so next time I'll mix them up in 2 batches. Just wondering if the mixture is freezable for camping trips?Cheers :0)",

				"Hi Ania,This looks absolutely super delicious - gorgeous photos - and I shall have a go at your recipe for tomorrow's Sunday dinner. The stew reminds me of a dish I enjoyed in Crete many years ago. Greek food - a rather underrated cuisine methinks - is simply the best, particularly the vegetarian (and fish) dishes. I do plan to use store-bought, cooked chick peas, but I'm wondering, do I need to heat them in advance or do I just throw them in? But when do I do that? And how long should the stew cook in all? Also, if I add cubed potatoes, I take it you mean raw, cubed potatoes? Lots of questions, sorry about that. Hope to hear from you. \u0395\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd! Meanwhile, let me put a bottle of retsina in the refrigerator... Best,Hansxx",

				"This stew was enjoyed by everyone!  It was easy to prepare and full of flavour. I especially appreciated the citrus which brought some sunniness to our endless end of winter days",
				"Absolutely delicious! Make sure to cook enough to yield leftovers and leave the lemon peels in overnight - it's even better the next day! Super simple to make, the ingredients going in are few and humble but the resulting flavours are out of this world. I recommended it to friends and family already and I will certainly be making it again for me and my partner! Thanks Ania, I love your recipes and photos :)",
				"I made this recipe and added cumin for an extra kick.  It is delicious hot or cold.  I tossed over baby spinach and made a salad. It\u2019s a versatile recipe.",
				"Finally I got to try this for vegan Mondays. Absolutely amazing combo of flavors; a festival in mouth. And best of all is easy and quick. Thank you!",
				"Amazing, amazing, amazing! This is my go to dish whenever I want to impress non vegans or just want to have tasty ball of greatness for myself and my husband (my kids are not yet into vegan food). And the quality of this recipe is really of high restaurant standards! Sometimes I cook it just with onions if I dont have leaks or shallot handy. Thank you, Ania for making delicious food of the greatest quality available to everybody!",

				"Really really good idea for adding creaminess with the plant milk! I find it also a good idea to cook the chickpeas separately, because I make a big pot and store in servings in the freezer. Tahini is great addition too in the end!!!Very delicious! And I think spinach will be the go to green for me! And I also like your stories accompanying the recipes!Thank you",

				"Hi Ania - I am new to your blog and this is the first recipe of yours I made and it was so delicious! I made it a day ahead during my Saturday meal prep and ate it last night - so good! I cooked my chickpeas from scratch so added a couple of tablespoons of aquafaba when I processed 1/3 of the chickpeas with the milk. I used Silk soy organic unsweetened and instead of tahini I soaked 2 tablespoons of walnuts in hot water for a couple of hours and blended them with the chickpeas, garlic and milk. It was easy to prepare and the flavors were so good! I will definitely be making this again. Next up from your blog I want to make the coconut tofu with green beans and the miso chickpeas. Thank you for posting and sharing.",
				"OMG! this was so good, and very easy to make. Not obvious, surprising, very refreshing  flavours. I was sceptic about adding whole garlic, but believe me, once you blend it with chickpea and plant milk, it gives very smooth, delicate texture and stron smell disappears. I used almond milk. Definitely this dish will be repeated soon! <3",
				"Delicious! Really enjoyed this and it's very different to anything I've made before. Yummy with the crusty bread and added chili oil drizzled on top! I also added a few \"meat\" balls for extra protein.",

				"This was just what I was looking to have for dinner this evening and it is super delicious! Your recipes always turn out fantastically. Great depth of flavou, even though I\u2019m currently cooking without oil and salt ( I did add miso to my bowl after serving). A great way to use up greens -  and even if like me you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t usually like creamy dishes, give this one a go (I used oatly\u2019s oat cream for that step).

				"Hi Ania,I am looking to replace sugar with dates, soaked in water and blended. Should I keep the same quantities? Would it work?Thank you for your work \ud83e\udd70",
				"Your cake is delicious Ania. I used more silken tofu (the package was 350g) and less cashews and a little bit more tapioca starch as I was not sure of the texture after baking. It turned out perfect and  it tasted very good.  We ate it with fresh berries and it was delicious ! Thank you for this great recipe !",
				"Hi once again! what about milk?  Will fatty (19-20%) coconut milk be ok? or rather thinner plant milk, such as soy or almond milk, will be better in this recipe? Is lemon juice necessary if I want to get vanilla flavor cheesecake? Does it only give flavor or does it have other uses?",
				"hi Ania, Have I missed something about coconut cream? doesn't seem to be in the recipe. Its says oat milk, so I'm not sure what you mean by \"thin milk won't work\" ?",
				"Hi Ania, I tried this dish with 150g cashews: 300g tofu, and also with 100g cashews: 300g tofu, and both worked really well with no taste of tofu. I also used EVOO in the crust and this worked well too. And my 8yr-old daughter suggested adding freeze-dried raspberries, which added lovely little bursts of flavour!",
				"can I make this cheesecake as a nut-free version? did you try to prepare it without cashews?",
				"Thank you for this lovely recipe!I made it yesterday morning. The crust was fine. It didn't need any baking stones or rice. I knew my dark coconut sugar would turn the tart brown, but I used it anyway  because I had nothing else. Everything was fine otherwise. Texture is solid and tastes just like lemon cheesecake. I let it cool down in the kitchen then transferred to the fridge for further setting up. We had a slice last night. Perfect!",
				"We did it! We used sicilian lemons and it was  heavenly. What do you think about trying a lime version? Would you Just use lime juice and zest in the same quantities?BaciSilvi",
				"Hi Ania, do you need to add any baking stones or filler like dried rice when you bake the base or does it hold its shape?",
				"First of: the fotos look stunning! Do you think I could replace the all purpose mix worth a combination of gf flours like rice flour and some more starch? And did you prebake the meringue and then just put it on top?Thanks!",
				"it can't be just quality of photos... I mean this looks amazing and delicious <3",
				"Looks amazing! Is there a substitute for physillium husks? Thanks!",
				"Would firm tofu work? Silkem is hard to get where I live!",
				"This looks wonderful! Could I use olive oil in the crust? And could I replace half of the cashews with more silken tofu (trying to reduce the sat fat for health reasons)? Many thanks and Happy Easter to you :-)",
				"Do you us brown or white jasmine rice? Also if I cannot find savoy cabbage what other cabbage type would you recommend using?"

				"Thanks so much Ania! Will definitely try that!I have a couple more questions if thats ok! Ive managed to find a 25cm square dish but it looks a bit shallower than yours - do you have the depth of the dish you used please?Also I noted that you serve it at room temp or slightly warmer - do you have to prep your guests in advance so theyre not expecting something super hot like a normal lasagna?Sorry for all the silly questions!Lu x",
				"Love all of your recipes! This one in particular is a winner!!! Delicious!!! Couldn\u2019t wait the full hour before tucking in.. maybe around 20mins! Which worked out perfectly! Held its shape completely!! Making again!! And again! Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude0d",
				"Fancy, and delicious! I did use sunflower seeds and tofu to make the bechemel instead of flour and olive oil. Perfect! And the ragu was wonderful. Thank you!!",
				"This is absolutely delicious and easy to make!! The mushrooms add wonderful texture, the spices and bechamel make this a wonderful dish for the holidays or anytime really. It tastes even better the next day. Ania is the best, thank you for all of the amazing vegan dishes you share.",
				"Hello\u2026do I have to add the nutritional yeast to the b\u00e9chamel pls?",
				"Hi, what could I sub for Tapioca or could I just leave it out?",
				"I'd like to cook this for Christmas day, but my husband is allergic to mushrooms, what do you think might work instead?",
				"My husband, son and I absolutely loved this recipe. It was super tasty and it is definitely one I will make again. I also plan to make just the ragu to have with spaghetti and the bechamel to have with an Italian style lasagne. There are some leftovers but I daresay they will not last for long!",
				"Absolutely delicious! Used to love pastitio pre-vegan so this is such a treat to be able to have it again- the bechamel is amazing.",
				"Love this recipe ! So easy to make and great flavors.  I invited my vegan neighbors to enjoy and they loved it \ud83d\ude0a.  I will be making this again.",
				"Thanks for the inspiration for a fun few hours in the kitchen this afternoon! Prior to going vegan, pastitsio was what I always felt like making as it got close to the time of our town's annual Greek festival. Love the combination of mixed mushrooms and lentils. I added a few button mushrooms with the shiitake and cremini.  I like how it worked with ziti pasta boiled for just five minutes. I appreciate the pro tip to cook for half the package directions. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! Definitely will make this a few times a year.",
				"THIS IS MAGIC! Comfort food in a baking dish, and the unexpected spices add the best touch. I have yet to get my noodle base looking as perfect as the picture, but who cares? The result is amazing.",
				"Such a great recipe\u2014 a little involved, but a great Sunday project!  I made the bechamel with no oil!!!  I used 1 c oatmilk (leaving 2 c to add later) to suspend the flour.  I added 1 tbsp tapioca flour to help thicken it.  Turned out PERFECT.  Next time I might roast some carrots to add to the ragu\u2014 you can\u2019t have too much umami.  Everyone (15 yo daughter included)   Loved it.",
				"Made this for my Dad's birthday has he grew up loving pastitsio and is now vegan. We all absolutely loved it!!!! Thanks for this recipe.",
				"This dish was amazing! It had the perfect flavour profile and was a restaurant quality dish. My family of four devoured the whole thing in one sitting it was so good!",
				"I so appreciate your time and the links, thank you! I'm going to get some, can't wait, this is a game changer!",
				"So I didn't want to take up any more of your time and thought I'd just Google kombu, because I've never heard of it. I couldn't get a satisfactory answer. Would you mind telling me about it and how it helps? Do you use it with all beans?Thank you again!",
				"Thank you so much for the quick response, very helpful,  thank you!",
				"I made this for dinner last night, wowza, so good! It's a time investment, but so worth it. What do you think about adding dried lentils and extra water to the ragu while it's simmering, rather than add already cooked lentils at the end?",
				"Our daughter made this for us recently - it was amazing ! The ragu is so so tasty, I think this is definitely a dish that would win round vegan sceptic dinner guests. Thanks for sharing xx",
				"This was a hit in our house, we're not vegan, but are trying to eat more plant based, as much as possible. My meat loving, mushroom hating son even loved this one, so that's high praise indeed! Loads of flavour and full of umami, so we really loved this one and will do it again. Thanks!",
				"I've made this recipe today. Replaced lentils with whole mung beans and used fettuccine pasta. We eat lentils often, I just wanted some variety. The fettuccine was the only pasta I had at home. The recipe looks very complicated, but it is worth following exactly, if only to get the feel and taste of the intended result. I can think of many variations for that middle layer! I really liked the pasta trick - undercooking the pasta, then mixing with vege milk and tapioca. The pasta will be chewy and will stick together nicely. I let the pastitsio rest for 30 minutes before eating - we just couldn't resist the aroma :-P.If you cook the pasta first and then layer it in the baking dish, you can reuse the pot to make the top layer, saves on washing.",
				"Loved this thank you. This was always my favourite dish when in Greece when I ate meat and I'd never made it before so it seems right that the first time I do it's vegan. The flavours took me there and whilst it takes a while it was sooo good with left overs too, although not as much as other have said!",
				"Hi! Just finished making this - it looks amazing but there's loads!! Can I freeze it?",
				"Hi Ania!I recently discovered your blog and am equally enjoy your writing voice as much as your delicious recipes. I\u2019m a very intuitive vegan cook, mostly reading food blogs for inspiration. However this time I more or less followed this recipe. I admittedly cheated with a jar of marinara sauce and some Moroccan spice blend. Oh my goodness. After eating this dish for dinner three nights in a row my husband and I will be mourning the absence of it in our refrigerator. I found myself thinking about it in the late afternoons, asking myself it was too early for dinner. Definitely a new favorite to make for guests, a holiday, or a particularly bleak feeling Monday. Thank you!",
				"Ania, this is so delicious! I love this take on lasagne, the cinnamon and clove are such great flavors! This will be a family favouritw for us. Thabk you for the great recipes. Clare",
				"This dish was OUTSTANDING!!!!  The only thing I did differently was I substituted meatless crumbles for the lentils, as I don't really care for them.   The ragu was so flavorful and the Bechamel was so delicious that I'm going to use it in other recipes.   Thanks for sharing this!  Will make again and again.",
				"Absolutely wonderful. I made  a day ahead and reheated for Easter Dinner. The non-vegans were going back for seconds!  Thank you so much!",
				"My grandmother used to make Pastisio. I look forward to trying a vegan version!",
				"Do you eat this at room temperature then, or if you wait a day and store in the fridge - are you eating it cold? Thanks.",

				"Update as promised - I ground up the date sugar but actually it is quite finely ground to begin with. The Whole Food Plant Based version of the chocolate is just as delicious as the original, no graininess at all. It is so good that DH decided to make his own with nuts and raisins, his favorite. Thank you Ania, commercially produced chocolate is now a thing of the past for us.",
				"I am actually going to try grinding up date sugar as it is considered the only \u201cwhole\u201d sugar. It tends to not dissolve as completely as  other sugars due to its fiber but I am hoping that since the chocolate will contain lots of chopped nuts, any slight graininess from the sugar won\u2019t be noticeable. I will let you know. Thanks for some great recipes. Mary.",
				"I don\u2019t know why I have never made chocolate before. Thank you for this recipe which is incredibly  easy to make. It is a big hit! I had no hazelnuts so I used organic almond butter and chopped up organic almonds. Delicious!  What a treat. Now I am going to experiment to see if I can make it Whole Food Plant Based, so no refined sugar.",
				"I made these today and it was AMAZING !! Thank you so much for the recipe. I made it with maple syrup. Wanted to know if I wanted it less bitter how do I alter the recipe ? Thanks !",
				"Hi Ania, I love your vegan recipes. Thank you for them. You said you are not sure if the chocolate can be tempered on this page because you added hazelnut butter. Well as a chocolatier I can answer that\ud83d\ude0a. The chocolate recipe if it is made with icing sugar or in my case because I am diabetic I use icing Swerve or any erythritol or powdered Allulose , then will temper easily because hazelnut butter is fat based. However,  if you use any liquids in the mix like maple syrup, the moisture or water content  of maple syrup or agave nectar will cease your cocoa butter and it turns into a sludge or mud like texture. For me a day without chocolate is a day without sunshine. So thank you for this recipe, I would temper mine and add two tablespoon of organic olive oil to the hazelnut butter to get a smoother texture and not melt in my hands so easily.Cheers,Hanna Baroncelli@fuchsiachocolatier"

I swapped in red onion because I didn't have any shallots, and didn't want to open a bottle of wine but a bit of Canadian lager made a good stand-in.

I had very similar pains and that's what it was. Mine had gotten very severe before I sought help though and the ER nurses were concerned I could have had sepsis! So scary.  Surgery was really a breeze, luckily, and fortunately we don't really need gallbladders. Anyway, these scones look amazing and I cannot wait to try them once our rhubarb is in!

I'm on a low sat fat diet so I use almond butter (smooth or crunchy), skip the chocolate, and throw in raisins with the oats.

I made the recipe as stated and from the moment I started cooking the first one, we knew it would be a hit.  They smell exactly like real Turkish lamacun!!!  My only regret is not doubling the recipe.  So so good!",
				"I got so excited when I saw this recipe! I've never had traditional lahmacun, but always wanted to try one (minus meat). I've made this once with soy mince, but it was rather bland and the texture wasn't right. This recipe is a game changer! Even though I had neither pomegranate molasses nor roasted pepper (I used a couple of dried tomatoes, lemon juice and some ground walnuts ) it turned out so delicious! The tofu topping tasted very strong but it mellowed perfectly after baking and the texture was very nice too. I used some leftover flat bread dough and it worked great. Next time I'll try it with pizza dough! Thank you for a great recipe!",
				"Thanks for this recipe. It was very tasty. I have seen these often in street food markets in London but never found a vegan version. It was genuinely quick to make. I made the dough the night before and after that it took just over 50 minutes to prepare everything bake the pizzas as well as to tidy up and there was enough filling for two more meals as I was just making it for myself. The first time I used a sourdough for the bread but the next time I realised I did not have any yeast so I make a kind of quick bread dough mixing flour with vegan yogurt and baking soda. I just chopped all the vegetables, parsley and tofu finely and it worked well. I did not have pomegranate molasses so I added about a teaspoon of  anardana powder (ground dried pomegranate) for half a batch of the salad and used coconut sugar in place of date syrup in the filling. I didn't have pul biber either so used a couple of crushed dried chillis.",

				"So delicious! I did make some alterations (because I can\u2019t seem to follow a recipe off the internet word-for-word even from a site like this one with well researched and tested recipes): I added 1/8t cinnamon because I love it in my oatmeal cookies and reduced salt by half because mom is on a low sodium diet. I also used half GF flour as mentioned in the notes (Bobs red mill 1:1 in my case). I also used half coconut oil and half Follow Your Heart soy-free vegan butter because that\u2019s what I had - which totally works in case someone is reading this and doesn\u2019t have or like coconut oil. So yummy, soft and delicious and EASY! Next time I will make a double batch and add chopped walnut or pecans (yes, this will likely result in cookies that break apart easy, but I do miss the nut flavor). Thank you!",
				"Made these tonight.... Amaxing. Such a perfect texture. Mix of chewy and crisp. I didn't have unscented coconut oil so used regular coconut oil and they were perfect. No taste of coconut anyways. I used only flour instead of the oat flour as suggested but simply because I didn't have oat flour. Thanks again for such a gorgeous vegan recipe.",

They are best after sitting for a few hours.  Try to keep from cutting into them right out of the oven as the texture develops as they cool completely.  I made the recipe exactly wthout any changes, except after they were cooled I glazed them with a thin coating of chocalate glaze. Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper.",

I also added nuts and extra chocolate to make it more appealing to children. Finally, everyone enjoys the perfect crust and slightly fluffy interior.",
				"Hi Ania, First time trying your recipes and it was delicious! We used a combo of cocoa butter and coconut oil and melted chocolate chips instead of using a baking bar and something about that combination made it very chewy and fudgy. Thank you for the great recipe! Looking forward to trying more! :)",

It formed the perfect crust and seems to be a good combination of gooey/fudgy to appease any discerning chocolate brownie lovers tastes. I really appreciated your taking the time to respond to my Instagram tag and advice at how to manage the intensity of the chocolate flavour given the specific ingredients that I used. I am going to try this recipe again cutting down the raw cocoa powder I used to half the quantity, replacing it with plain flour. I look forward to experimenting further, but am very pleased with my first immediate results and simplicity of this recipe :-).",

				"Hi Ania,Thanks for this recipe.While I do not have any food allergies, I have made the decision to not use any type of wheat flour or any kind of granulated sugar except for coconut sugar. Also, I am experimenting with adding other natural sweeteners, such as - thoroughly processed Medjool dates(or other dates), apricots, cherries, and other dried, reconstituted fruits made into paste in a processor and, once-in-a-while, maple syrup(but, very little).  It'll be fun experimenting with these types of substitutions!~Carol"

				"There isn't really anything more that I can add to what's already been said about your culinary genius, so rather than highlight all the many brilliances of this dish I just want to talk singularly about the inspired use of cauliflower leaves. I have literally never seen or read a recipe before that uses these inner leaves; searching the internet now there are a few mentions here and there but it's certainly not commonplace in any sense. Pulling the tray out of the oven earlier today to find these heavily toasted, caramelised leaves exuding this nutty, hoppy, slightly weedy smell was an absolute delight. To then realise that their place in the dish also involved them being a textural and flavoural bridge between the softer caramelised leeks and the harder caramelised cauliflower really just blew my mind. Absolute brilliance.",

I am not a big fan of alcohol in baked goods myself, but it shows you can mix them up however you like as long as you keep the bun and (vegan) cream. That intrigues me; I wonder what my ideal semla would look like...perhaps a gf bun made from sorghum flour, some oat flour and soaked, pur\u00e9ed buckwheat kernels, and filled with a silky hazelnut chocolate nut butter and chopped almonds, topped with vanilla scented vegan cream... \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0b",

We used cashew-hazelnut butter. The second time we added more Amaretto because it's a match made in marzipan heaven. Rolling in chocolate without making a huge mess was a bit of learning curve.  Next time we plan to coat them with raw chocolate and maybe reduce a little bit of the sweetener. They are so rich in taste that although the recipe already doesn't have a lot of maple syrup, for my taste it can easily have even less. That could of course be due to the extra alcohol that we added. Thank you, Ania, for the inspiration and a perfectly tuned out recipe!",

				"Hey Emma, I've made the recipe with the vegan applewood cheese so the calories might be slightly different and I added 10 more grams of flour to thicken up my sauce-but it shouldn't make much difference. The whole recipe is 1400kcl, if you have 4 servings out of it, one serving is roughly 350kcl. Hope that helps!",
				"I made this yesterday just for myself and almost ate the entire dish in one go! (Granted, my package of gnocchi was smaller than 500g) I added sage and a splash of white wine to the mushrooms, and I used grated vegan cheese (which didn't really melt, but it still tasted good), and my, what a creamy, umami, comforting meal! Dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 za przepis Ania, like all the others I've tried from your blog it was delicious!Verena (the Polish learner who asked you for more Polish content, if you remember!)",

I thoroughly enjoyed making it and even more so eating it.I didn\u2019t have everything so substituted broccoli for sliced Brussels sprouts and used sage instead of thyme.It was delicious and loved by the family.Thank you!",
				"Made this as written, and it was DELIGHTFUL!!!! We're having the leftovers tonight. I'm excited to make this again, maybe with cavalo nero instead of the broc. My only tweak was adding some water to the bechamel as it cooked - mine got thick! We used Vegan Chao for the grated cheese and it was perfect. I'll definitely make this again!",

Crisp and moist, super tasty :-)I did not have courgette so used a quite dry apple, and added a bit of aquafaba to make up for the lost moisture.I had already cooked the chickpeas, so followed your guidance on adjusting the quantity and they turned out great.Thank you ! x",
				"Soo delicious and stay healthy!!It's great recipess, thanks for sharing this Ania :)",
				"Hi Ania, Thank you for your suggestions, they were very helpful! I made these today and had to do a lot of substitutions because I noticed midway through that I was missing a few ingredients. So I subbed apples for courgette, defrosted kale for spinach, fennel leaves for coriander, added a dash of Chinese 5 spice and it turned  out so delicious... and *moist* on the inside. I couldn't really taste the apple btw. Thank you for the recipe, I hope I'll be able to make it with courgette in the future - Basia xx",

I also *hate* frying.One question, is there anything I can sub the courgette with...? With the lockdown in the UK I kind of want to avoid grocery shopping as much as I can... Courgettes have a mushy texture when cooked so I was thinking apples, sauteed carrots, maybe green peas...?  What are your thoughts? If not possible, I was thinking of revisiting your sweet potato falafel recipe which I haven't made in a while and I remember being super obsessed with them :) Thanks,Basia x",

I am planning to make it tonight as a side dish for a full platter of dishes, do you have any recommendations on what to combine this with? I was thinking of hummus and perhaps a salad, any recommendations regarding different flavours that go well together, will be super helpful!",

But next time I made them, I doubled the flax seeds to 4 tbsp and used 8 tbsp of water.  This makes them slightly firmer so that you can, at least dip them into humus without them crumbling into bits.  By the way, I mill my own flaxseed, so that wasn\u2019t the problem.  I also use cumin instead of rosemary, but that\u2019s just my preference.  Regardless - they are delicious and thank you for the recipe!",

The halved recipe made 8 rice-wrapper spring rolls.The flavours were fantastic, and I'll definitely be making them again and again - they made a really satisfying meal with a little stir-fried vegetable rice. The mushroom/cabbage/carrot filling works brilliantly.  Thank you Ania!",
				"I just made these using Napa cabbage and a mixture of maitake (hen of the woods) and cremini mushrooms and no oil. They're really good. I'm definitely making a double batch next time and freezing. These spring rolls are my go-to recipe now. Thank you!",
				"All of your recipes are delicious!",
				"Hi Ania. Thanks for the reply. I made the baked version last night and I think they are superior. Well worth the wait in the oven. This is one of my very favourite recipes. They really remind me of Peking duck flavour. And this time I made a vietnamese nuoc cham sauce to have them with. These could be served at a dinner party for sure!",
				"I made these yesterday and they are absolutely awesome. I have been looking for a great vegan spring roll recipe as they are my true weakness. I used dried shitake and rehydrated them along with the oyster mushrooms. My daughter, who is beyond fussy and eats almost no vegetables, loved the smell of the filling cooking, which I agree smelled fantastic. I replaced the vermicelli with strips of tofu marinated in soy and oven baked, just because I'm off noodles at the mo. I was so tired after a hectic day that I ended up shallow frying them. I think they were a bit too oily so next time (tonight with the extras) I will oven bake. My daughter ate one as well and loved it which was amazing. Really great recipe Ania!",

				"We made this for New Years Day and my carnivore Aunt said it was delicious and she'd be delighted to have it again. It came out a little bit smaller than the pictures, but that might be because I chopped most of the mushrooms in the food processor - either way, it was still enough as part of a roast dinner for 6, and we'll definitely be making it again! Thank you!",
				"Made both the sausage roll and gravy for Christmas lunch, easy to make and delicious! Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!",
				"We cooked this giant sausage roll as the meat replacement of our Christmas dinner. We cooked it with smoked tofu and it was simply delicious. Instructions were (as always) easy to follow. Even though the gravy required a bit of work, it was worth the effort as it is so full of flavour. I cooked it with gf puff pastry, froze part of it and it turned out really well! Thank you so much for another delicious recipe!",
				"This is an absolute gem of a recipe! Delicious, beautiful, straightforward to put together, and just as big a hit with the non vegans as us. I used filo in place of puff pastry to cater for dietary stuff and that worked out beautifully too. Can\u2019t recommend highly enough! Thanks Ania!",
				"Could I make this in advance and freeze it after cooking?",

				"Thank you for your advice, Ania! I used about 300 g of pastry. It was quite a struggle to roll 3 individual pieces into one large neat sheet. I shouldn't have tucked the pastry under the log into more than one layer 'cause in some places it remained raw. Luckily the top was perfect! Delicious and fairly easy to make, in comparison to Wellington. It was a hit at the birthday dinner. Thank you for another awesome recipe!",
				"Made this yesterday for Halloween (possibly a rehearsal for Xmas) and all I can say is Yum! The gravy was also absolutely delicious. The best praise came from my carnivorous partner who simply said \"More\".  May have to make two next time as think he could probably eat a whole one himself. Thanks so much.",
				"Super tasty and versatile recipe. Although it takes slightly longer to prep and cut all ingredients, it is very much worth it. Instead of using the 'meat' for a sausage roll, I've shaped it up into 'meat' balls and sausages to add to traybakes with great results. It's also super convenient for batch making and meal prepping and a family favourite!",
				"I made the roll for my solo new year\u2019s eve dinner and it was really delicious!",
				"Made this for New Years Eve and it came together in a breeze! Didn't have vegan Worcester sauce or nutritional yeast so I used red miso and black salt instead. It was delicious, light and the gravy complemented the roll perfectly!",

Before blending it, I fished out some to use as a decoration. If your mass will be to runny just cook it a bit longer but also remember that it will thicken once it cools down",

The nerve of some people is mind boggling.Honestly, your blog and Dora's Table are my two favorite spots on the internet.  I've been making something from one or each of your pages each week ever since Covid hit, and it's been a little bright spot in this darkness.  If you ever come out with a cookbook, I'll be first in line to buy it! And these look lovely. I might  make these little crusts and fill half with the filling from the pumpkin pie recipe for a little variety! Thanks for another lovely little recipe.",
				"Ania, I'm so sorry your hard work is being misappropriated and passed off by others as their intellectual property. You are a fantastic cook and an excellent baker.

				"Hi Ania,  Let me start by saying I made these cookies twice  and hope to make them lots  more times.  The first time, I followed your instructions, exactly including the part on dividing the dough into 12 cookies.  Well, they were gigantic! And as they baked they got larger and larger, and the 10-12 minutes baking time was not even close.  I removed them from the oven at about 16 minutes, concerned that I might burn them, but they weren't even close to being done.  I ended up baking them for about half an hour and they  turned out delicious!  That was about 2 weeks ago.  Today, I tried again, using a very small ice cream scooper and got 46 cookies, baking each batch 10 minutes in a turbo oven at 170 degrees C.  They are perfect!!!  Thank you for a terrific recipe.",

				"I've made these twice already and love them! I don't usually enjoy walnuts in cookies but these really bring out the flavor and it is super delicious together! I like to freeze these and eat one when I need a sweet treat, they're great frozen and not too hard. With the scooper I use, I get about 2 dozen out of these cookies so that's a bonus too! Thanks so much! <3",

And feeling so proud of my fellow Pennsylvanians for sealing the deal with the election! Also thank you for a recipe that doesn't make three dozen cookies. I would have eaten them all!",

I like to sweeten my pancakes enough so I don't have to pour more maple syrup on top.   Though adding the maple syrup does darken the pancakes a lot because of the caramelization.

Thankyou so much and may you have a cosy evening too! XXX",

I too have tinnitus as of about 5 years and am deaf in my right ear and awaiting an appt at the hospital. It is so annoying but I do wonder if it is caused by all the wifi and 5g and who knows what else..... it has just crept up on me and so let us hope for duncan that he will find a way. Good luck! :)",

Most oranges (and clementines, satsumas, etc.) from supermarkets and greengrocers aren't vegan because they are coated with beeswax or shellac - look for E901 or E904 in tiny print on the label. If you want unwaxed oranges, you will probably need to buy the organic ones.",

The orangey tang is just right with the almond. You keep \u2018em comin\u2019 and I\u2019ll keep on makin\u2019 \u2018em (and the bearded one here says he\u2019ll keep on eatin\u2019 \u2018em) lol.",

I can't imagine how frustrating it is, but maybe this is another avenue to explore in meditation? Thank you for your  recipes, always enjoy trying them!",
				"So sorry to hear about the tinnitus! My sister went through a bout a few years ago and she told me that she worked on telling herself that she was simply hearing the song of the universe. It helped her in way that made it a bit less overwhelming. Wishing Duncan wellness. My sister's is not an issue anymore! AND I am excited to try the cookies!"

				"Amazing. Incredible. Stellar. Iconic. Your flavors are always perfect. Truly a blessing of a website",
				"Oops, I'm realizing my comment didn't make it clear that I did in fact try this recipe! I thought the flavors in the sauce were really well-balanced, to give some context to my original compliments :)",
				"Holy moley this was AMAZING. I put the eggplant into the oven in small pieces like the other reviews suggested and doubled the amount of gochujang. Such an easy weekday lunch that came together in 20 minutes. I'll be making this over and over and over again. Thank you!!",
				"Made this for dinner last night, cooking the eggplant in the oven with no oil is a game changer, it browned up and no more oil soaked eggplant! I would add a little more gochujang but I like spicy. My partner said this dish was spot on. Thanks",
				"I made this for dinner yesterday and it was a nice and easy weeknight option. I love Asian food, specifically Korean and Japanese cuisine so the flavours for this was a treat! Thanks for the recipe!",
				"I love this recipe!  I have made it a bunch of times.  I'm not the biggest fan of eggplant, but the flavor of this is strong and the baking process for the eggplant takes care of the texture issues for me.  I have also made this with cubed tofu in place of eggplant.  It is good with or without the coriander.  I have doubled the sauce before and tossed it with a lot of steamed broccoli to bulk it up with veg.  It's very fast and easy.",
				"Wow! Absolutely delicious flavours and simple to execute. I'll be saving this to my favourite week night recipes. Thanks Ania!",
				"Hi Ania. We had this for dinner last night and I just wanted to let you know how great it was \u2014 delicious with complex flavours.  I served it with steamed Chinese greens with your Sesame  Dressing \u2014 yummy!",
				"Thanks for the response! Yes I was thinking of making the aubergine ahead and doing the rest on the night. Thanks again :)",
				"Looks lovely! Thinking about making it for a dinner party, do you think I can make it ahead of time? Thanks!",
				"I used to live in South Korea so always have a tub of gochujang in the fridge, but I\u2019ve always tended to use it in traditional Korean dishes. This is a great alternative. I\u2019ve made this about 3 or 4 times now, as a main and as a side dish to sweet potato curry and it always turns out well.",
				"This was absolutely delicious. Beautiful ingredients, and stunning flavours!!!Served it with choy sum and brown rice. Beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!!",
				"This might be the best meal i have ever made myself! I will eat this every week for the rest of my life. It really is just perfect. The sauce is great and EXACTLY the right amount. Spot on!",
				"\"Spot on!\" My other half commented. This is a really quick and easy meal to make. Packed full of flavour too. We chopped the aubergines into chunks first which cut down on cooking time. I'm always skeptical with recipes that include maple syrup as they can be so sweet, but the proportions of the ingredients in sauce worked extremely well. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Yummie this was so good. I made these delicious eggplants this evening and I couldn't stop eating. So good and so easy to make. The only thing I changed up I made was that I already cut up the eggplant in smaller pieces before I put them in the oven.Every now and then we have an eggplant-week: I cook every night a meal with eggplant, but every evening something else. Next time these gochuang eggplants are in!thanks you for your lovely recipes, Ania!",
				"Czesc Ania,Made it yesterday for dinner and it was delicious and super easy. Thank you! Ania would you consider taking on gochujang recipe?  All the teady pastes are terrible in ingredients and the traditional recipe is way too complicated. It would be great to have a recipe with no soy , no corn or nasty sweeteners.  Kasia",
				"I love eggplant and have been craving it. Baba ghanoush was going to make an appearance until I saw this recipe. It was perfect! Baking the eggplant worked so well and was hands off. I hate ordering eggplant out as it's always soaked with oil and mushy. Smitha asked for a date night recommendation and I think soup  would be a great starter. Your miso pumpkin soup would be great and also seasonal.",
				"I want to make this for date night -what would recommend as a starter/side?",
				"Oh man, this looks so yum!!  I'm fasting for a few days, so I can't wait to try it out!!! Eggplants are easily available here in Greece , hopefully cilantro will still be on the market, as I think that is absolutely essential :)",
				"I'm in! Just added eggplant to my grocery list (not that I ever really need inducement to do so as it's one of my favorite veggies), because this recipe looks heavenly. Thank you, as always, for making it so easy for me to cook wonderful meals."

I didn't make the frosting, as I did not have any cashews [like mentioned earlier, I just needed to get rid of some carrots before they went bad], but would love to make it again with frosting.

				"Fantastic recipe!! Will definitely be making these again.",
				"These look fantastic. I also just took a realistic look at myself and realized I need to make some changes to feel my best. Intermittent fasting has been great so far - it seems hard at first and then it feels natural. If I want to eat a cupcake, it feels better to say, look, you can eat it later if you want. Somehow I don't tend to want it later, afterall, or if I do, it's ony one, not three! Thanks for being so open here, this has become one of my favorite food sites. Saving the recipe for my birthday. So excited to try a cashew icing :)",
				"=)  It will be  worth It in the end.... That is so true!!!! Thank you for the reply. Oh, and I read the other recipe, the almond cookies, and I'm sorry to hear about whats happening with Duncan. I hope he will be able to take the exam soon to understand what is happening, take care and be cured! \ud83d\ude4f Kisses from Brazil. Camila.",
				"Hello! I love this recipe... :) And I'm very happy that you shared this part of your life here. The same thing had happened to me all my life, but since the end of July I started to change and I'm so happy about It too!!! I realy know and understand what you're feeling. =) Congratulations for taken this step foward, and stay strong! Kisses from Brazil. Camila."

				"This is such a great dish!!!! My friend, who is not so big on being plant based, remarked after, \"I think I should try going eating plants instead of meat for like 30 days!\" If that isn't a sign that this recipe is AMAZING, I don't know what is!",
				"The colour looks very attractive! I like beetroots not only its colour but also its health benefit. It decides us nutrition, vitamin C and B9. Additional the little bit fat of walnut makes this recipe quite healthy. I like to sprinkle more basil.",
				"This recipe came to me in the exact, perfect time, which is time for the homegrown beetroot. I baked the cauliflower, as recommended in the recipe, and mixed it with homemade walnut butter (so potent there was no need for additional oil). And of course added all the rest. The outcome is just divine! So yummy, and so filling, love it! Silky cauliflower paste with the texture of beetroot, and crunchiness of the freshly roasted walnuts...purrrrfect!",
				"Would this be good at room temperature, like for a picnic? ThanksPs I adore skordalia made with almonds",

				"Stupidly delicious as always; I'm in particular awe of how you give such simple ingredients a particular depth in a way that bypasses usual flavour templates and connects to the earth itself. That might sound absurdly metaphysical but I choose to believe that someone's appreciation and devotion can translate in such a way. In any case, since discovering your blog a few years ago my family's weekly cooking routine has gradually grown to use those that you've shared predominantly, simply because they're the best options available. If you were ever to release a physical book of recipes for easy reference I'd be beyond keen to get multiple copies to send to friends and family, particularly those that chase me up months after the fact for \"that pasta I made one time\".Thankful for your genius,Arthur",
				"I used a similar recipe to yours the other day which used Hemp Seeds instead of Pine Nuts and it was delicious and am sure more nutritious.  I shall try your recipe out next using Pumpkin Seeds as I\u2019m sure that will work great too."

Also, I see in your previous dough you suggest reducing the aquafaba, but in this one not... Would you suggest I can follow this one or should I rather follow the link one...?With this one can I also make the dough a day ahead?Thanks so much, really want to give these dumplings a bash!X",

It's reasonably yummy, but not hitting the spot I was hoping it was.",

I\u2019m off to work, so can they sit (in a zip lock bag in fridge) for 8 hours or will that turn the veg?Cheers and will give you an update after I serve it.",
				"Really, really good and ridiculously easy! Really tasty marinade that turns to a nice sauce. Thank you!",

I made a couple of changes and used chipotle Chile powder, portobello and ah\u00edtale mushroom (only because I found your recipe after I grocery shopped). I was skeptical about it turning out tasting grilled but it did! Love the marinade. May need to use this on other recipes. Thank you!",
				"We made these fajita vegetables as part of a selection of filling for tacos. They were easy to make (I always appreciate being able to stick something in the oven) and full of flavour. The thickness of the sliced vegetables really makes a difference- some of our peppers were more thinly sliced, and while the flavour was good, the texture wasn't as satisfying as the larger pieces. These will definitely be included as regulars for future tacos.",

My favourite being roasted cauliflower and chickpeas slathered in the mix, then roasted for about 25 mins. Then I add roasted corn and some wilted spinach.",

				"Thanks for another aubergine recipe Ania.  The strange weather this year has given me a glut of aubergines and tomatoes .  Thanks also for the tip of baking aubergine slices with no need for salt or oil.  I learned that from you a couple of years ago in a moussaka recipe.  I have a wood-burning stove and if it's lit I bake aubergine slices and then cool them and pop them in the freezer compartment of my fridge - ready to add to any dish when needed."

I have a sour cherry tree in my garden that covers itself in fruit in late spring and so I'm always looking for new recipes as well as inviting Polish friends round to harvest as many as they can use\ud83d\ude0a.  The fruit makes jams and jellies with a wonderful balance of sweet and tart.  I'm interested in your mum's recipe as it has so little sugar.  How well does it keep?  Does it need to be pasteurised in a hot water bath?  I find that low sugar jam gets mouldy or ferments, especially if I don't keep it in the fridge, whereas higher sugar jam doesn't need to be pasteurised and can be stored in a cupboard.",

No matter what I do they always stick and become impossible to properly mix with the vegetables! Yesterday I was extra careful not to over cook them, I cooked them 3.5 minutes even though the package said 6, and they still became this sticky ball of noodles.

The 1st time I missed the instruction to turn the bun over after sealing and they all opened when baking, but they actually turned out to still be super delicious (just more like a danish pastry). The 2nd time I figured out the key to sealing is to follow the tip about making the edges thinner than the center - the dough cooperates a LOT more than if the dough is all the same thickness.",

If anyone else has ADY instead of instant, what I did was keep the yeast out of the dry ingredients in the first step, then proof the yeast in the warm plant milk with a teaspoon of sugar, and then mixed it in with the dry ingredients and vanilla. Making a second batch today since my husband has been talking about them nonstop!",
				"I was overjoyed to see this recipe on my Instagram feed. It sent me straight back to summers in Poland at my grandma\u2019s home :) I made these & they turned out yummy, but I had a bit of a dough problem. I remember following your recipe for drozdz\u00f3wki around Easter time, &  my dough had a similar issue. When I get to the kneading step, before adding the coconut oil, the dough is super crumbly & not very elastic. Even after adding the coconut oil, it breaks apart easily and is tough to knead. I tried to add a little more plant milk, and although this improved the texture, it definitely wasn\u2019t the same type of dough elasticity I\u2019ve experienced with breads. Do you have any idea what could be causing this/what to do next time? It causes my end product to be a tougher/harder texture and not as soft as I\u2019d like.",

I always preferred the ones filled with vanilla custard - I don't think my school sold jagodzinaki so I never tried one! :D but in the last few years my mum has been buying jagodzinaki from a bakery near her house which apparently are delicious but not vegan unfortunately so I don't know.I'm not having gluten (or sugar) because SIBO at the moment but will definitely make them once I can as a treat...!Speaking of being on a sentimental Polish cooking streak I've been living off Polish veggie soups pretty much throughout this whole summer (and quarantine.) My favourite one has been zupa botwinkowa...it's so so good and very easy to veganise.",

I even managed to get a few that didn't leak! (More leaked than didn't, but oh well.) I have never made filled buns like these before, so it was a fun new skill to learn.  Thanks!",
				"Yup! We're in the Appalachian Mountains, so that must have to do with the discrepancy. No matter, they came out just lovely!  I never had a jagodzianki before, so it was a fantastic new treat, thank you!",
				"Thanks, Ania! Who knows, maybe its something with the elevation or the weather here, but it rose overnight so now I can proceed! Thanks for the reply :) Looking forward to these treats!",
				"These look so lovely and are exactly the kind of fruit + bread combination to guarantee happiness! I love learning about the polish food you make -  the stories behind the recipes are always a highlight. Every year I go to a polish Christmas carol service here in New Zealand and there are all kinds of beautiful polish decorations and food made by the congregation. Just wondering about the buns: do you think there is any way to use frozen raspberries or blueberries... I'm worried that they might make things a little soggy but unfortunately can't find any fresh at the moment...Thank you!",
				"Hi! I was so excited to make these, but the dough never rose :( Any idea what went wrong? I know the yeast I used is good because I just used it yesterday for pizza dough.  Maybe it just needs more time?",

I love the crispiness of things that are fried but know that frying in oil is not the best thing. The air fryer has solved that problem - little or no oil and fabulous crispiness! I think that these spinach balls would be great done in it. They sound delicious and I can hardly wait to try them out!",

I reserved some of the sauce to simmer in a pot on the stove while it was baking. I also added a slash of red wine and towards the end a little sweetener to balance it. The additional sauce came in handy as the oven dried out the sauce a bit and it was especially helpful when reheating leftovers. I served this with crusty bread and a fresh green salad of arugula, baby kale cucumber and toasted pumpkin seeds with a homemade Dijon garlic dressing.

We've been eating a lot of ratatouille during lockdown and I was getting a bit fed up of courgettes to be honest, but this was the perfect  dish to get us to try something more adventurous. We completely forgot about the nutmeg, and I think we definitely went a bit overboard on the garlic, but it was absolutely delicious. As you say, slicing the courgettes is the trickiest part of the job (that was my department), and I definitely had a few rejects, but practice makes perfect! I might try the mandolin slicer next time, although that thing always scares me.Will save it for when we have guests next time, but thanks for a very tasty and unusual dish.",
				"I made it and it was lovely! My friend said he couldn't taste that it wasn't actual ricotta. I have to say it was quite some work, but I loved making it. I used a cheese slicer for the zucchini, and then stacked a few slices to roll it. That made it easier and a bit faster too, probably. I'll definitely make this again!",

You say in step 5 \"Saut\u00e9, stirring frequently the veggies\" and then in step 6 \" Remove the veggies from the oven\". How do I saut\u00e9 the vegetables if they're not already out of the oven? I'm French, maybe \"saut\u00e9\" is not  the same in English as in French, usually it means, stirring something in a saucepan over a medium heat, not baking in the oven. Did I miss something? I don't want to bother you with my questions or to be too fussy. It looks so delicious, that i want to be sure I understand things perfectly and that I don't ruin your gorgeous recipe in the end ;)Thanks for all your good work!",

The depth of flavor with the broth, the creamy mix in and the flavorings you add at the bottom of the bowl  really create a rich ramen base. I was missing some key ingredients (kombu, celery and mushrooms) but I used half vegetable stock in place of the water for the broth and  it was still very flavorful! Will 100% make again.",

Fortunately, my fianc\u00e9 is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so I get to eat it all by myself (our 4-year old granddaughter loved it at lunchtime today). The depth of flavors is amazing. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn\u2019t have any mirin for the flavorings in the bowl and added some sesame oil and black bean chili sauce to give it a kick. I plan to make a double or triple batch of the broth next time and freeze it. Thank you for this truly great recipe!",

The mixture of  the roasted sweet potato and garlic is a great idea ( I omitted the soy milk ) and is worth the effort . I added extra baby bok choy because it is a favourite vegetable of mine. This a a very versatile recipe as you can add what ever veggies are languishing in the fridge.",

				"Hi Ania, thanks so much for your swift reply earlier. I decided to experiment by making a half batch with banana instead of sweet potato, and if that was no good I was then going to use the link to the recipe in your reply  to me. However, the muffins have turned out  great, they are deliciously moist , fluffY and well risen! The only thing I would say, is that they took longer, 30 minutes till the skewer came out clean. I think maybe because mashed bananas are possibly more liquidy  than sweet potato, but this wasn\u2019t a problem anyway, just a slightly longer baking time. And you can taste the banana a bit too, but I like that. Thank you for a great recipe, I shall be using it often!",

I love the idea of using sweet potato in these muffins but I am wondering if I could adapt the recipe to not use chocolate so that I could make blueberry or apple or whatever else muffins.

I'm a pretty picky eater myself, but ever since going vegan I've noticed that I actually enjoy more foods then I thought, so I decided to give this recipe a try with my family, even though I usually prefer red pesto's made with sundried tomatos more and don't often enjoy a lot of toppings. I'm so happy that we decided to make it, as me and my entire family fell in love! It has a strong but amazing taste, and as our culture uses a lot of spices, we usually end up wanting more taste/spices in a recipe, but this was just perfect. We used pumpkin seeds as we didn't have any others, and decided to add some green beans for some extra protein! It was really tasty, and the green beans added a nice simple crunch. I do plan to cut the greenbeas a bit thinner or smaller next time to mix it better or opt for roasted chickpeas, either way it's a very easily adjustable recipe and so tasty! We still have some leftover sauce and I'm definitely gonna be using it again. I have a lot of recipes of yours that I've been wanting to try ever since I found this website 3 days ago, and after this amazing pesto recipe I'm very excited to try more of your amazing cooking! Thank you <3",
				"So delicious!",
				"I made this tonight substituting in your original wild garlic pesto because my son arrived home yesterday with a bag full of leaves and I didn't have any capers. Such a simple sounding dish but packed full of flavour, quick and easy to make and voted delicious by said son who is not a willing plant-based person. Will definitely be making this again very soon. Thanks, Ania, for a great recipe!",
				"Another lovely recipe :-) I added some spinach at the end to mine, which worked nicely. I do hope you're feeling better Ania.",
				"Great tips! Will definitely some of these for our home. Enjoy reading your posts!",
				"I really love your recipes - we have loads of wild garlic near where I live and I\u2019ve hardly used it before so it\u2019s nice to see a recipe using it. I\u2019m also very grateful for the glorious sunshine we\u2019re having at the moment   Life is beautiful despite what\u2019s going on around the world.",
				"Cze\u015b\u0107 Ania,what do you think, if one wants to make a batch which could make pasta happy longer than 2-3 weeks, what  ingredient could be an option to keep it longer fresh and alive?Or is that far beyond the science of preserving? ;)"

				"Hello, This recipe looks amazing! I look forward to trying it. I don't have any instant yeast, I only have active dry yeast. Can I use that in the recipe? If so, how would I use it with this recipe? Thanks so much!",
				"OMG, these came out Amazing! I made them twice and both times were fabulous!",
				"What a lovely recipe! I saw these on Instagram and made them immediately. I prepared the dough in the evening, let it rise overnight in the fridge, shaped and proofed in the morning. I used light spelt flour and olive oil, kneaded by hand. For the cashew cream, I used oatly barista and coconut sugar, ~50 ml lemon juice and cinnamon, omitted the coconut oil. The cashew cream by itself is delicious and the flavour (to me) is similar to that of sweetened tvorog. The recipe makes a lot, ~3x what you need for 1 batch of buns. I have also made these buns with rum-soaked raisins, marzipan, dark chocolate, strawberry jam, and with a rye and oat crumb topping. It\u2019s easier for me to brush the buns with maple syrup + splash of hot water after they come out of the oven, as opposed to doing the prebake \u201cegg wash\u201d. When we can travel again, I will definitely make these for long drives because they\u2019re not messy and keep me full. Thank you, Ania. I\u2019m looking forward to trying some more of your recipes!",
				"In the dough it says to add vanilla extract but it\u2019s not on the ingredient list for the dough. What measurement do I use?",
				"Yes - just the cream. Great. Thanks V much",
				"Hi  - i made twice the amount of cashew cream because I got the ratios wrong in the first batch so had to double up. Do you know if i can freeze it?? Thanks you!",
				"Tried the recipe for my family and they loved it :) it was a little emotional moment for me to remind myself of my roots and introduce my wife to this, I used to devour these as a little kid after whole day of playing outside with my mates and I was a little worried the kids wouldn't like the polish sweets but they made a giant mess after eating so that's  the perfect proof they enjoyed it.

				"Hi Ania, thank you so much for the wonderful recipies you create, I always have my Vegan and non-Vegan friends clamouring for more!                                                                             I have just made a lemon drizzle cake and an orange version and we're looking forward to diving into them later. However I have also tried to make these Polish Sweet Cheese Rolls this afternoon. They're not finished yet (the dough is on its second rise); however I found the dough remained extremely dry, even before I added the oil, so I wasn't able to stretch it as you suggested and resorted to kneeding it as best I could. I used Coconut sugar, so added a little extra milk to ensure there was enough moisture, so I'm not sure why the dough was so dry?  I know I have measured correctly and used fresh ingredients but it certainly didn't double in size.

This is amazing recepie, this sweet rolls are also tradition in my homecountry Latvia, I should give a try to this cuz all ingriedients I have at home and since I become vegan I was missing this simple cheese rolls so much! Yammy...Thank you for creating this recepie for us! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude00\ud83c\udf69",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks for your response. Because the recipe says \"1/2 + 1 tbsp\" of plant milk, I added 1 1/2 tbsp initially. However, after consulting with a friend, we realized that you may have meant \"1 cup + 1 tbsp\" of plant milk, which more properly equates to 135 ml. Is this the case?",
				"Are you sure the ratios for the dough ingredients are correct? When I followed your dough recipe I ended up having to add a cup or more of milk in order to make it come together. A few tablespoons of dough doesnt seem possibly sufficient. That said, this is a wonderful recipe and I will be making again.",
				"Dear Ania, Thank you for this creative recpie. I have never ate anything like this. But I will give it a try! Corona is not well for the peace of mind, health, the economy , and many other things,  but also not for my waistline. In order to keep my mind of checking the news, I keep on baking. I have made your Portugese Custard tarts, raspberry bakewell pie, scones in one week! My husband loved them! Tahnk you for providing a bit of comfort in these confusing times! Dear blog readers, Ania & Duncan, please be safe and healthy!Love from the Netherlands",
				"Do you think the dough will work with gluten free flour?",
				"Hi, I'm a vegetarian and not a vegan. I know I know I did tried but just couldn't do it. Instead of using \"vegan\" cheese what can I use?  Ricotta? It's a shame that my Polish grandmother dies when I was an infant so she never cooked for me.Thank you. Stay safe.",
				"Hi,These look delicious and somewhat similar to what my Mom used to make!Is instant yeast different from active dry yeast?Thank you for the great posts!Stay well!",
				"This looks delicious and a definite comfort food in these crazy times!If I use tofu for the filling, does this replace only the cashews?",
				"Can I use spelt flour instead of wheat flour?",
				"Thank you so much for all you do! Wishing you and your family health and stability in this crazy time. I bet you could use soaked raw  deskinned almonds instead of cashews! I have used almonds as substitute for vegan cheese many times when cashews weren't on hand.",
				"I saw your post on Instagram and had to check out this recipe! This looks so much like our Finnish rahkapiirakka which I miss so much. Sadly 2 of my kids (adult kids) are allergice to cashews, but, I'm wondering if the almond ricotta would work in this? I may try this weekend to make these. I'm a nurse and I am working full-time, but, this weekend we are all at my home (except 1 son). Everyone but my husband and I are able to work from home. I know what you mean about getting sucked into the vortex of the updates. I'll let you know how they turn out!!"

I have made many a lemon cake and I usually get some sort of unfavourable result (middle caving in, not the right texture, not the right flavour, etc) but this one looked as beautiful as the photo. Perfect recipe,  will be my new go-to lemon loaf.",
				"I made this cake into a Polish Easter babka and it worked so well! I was anxious about getting it out of the form but I didn't have to worry, it came out very easily - thank you for the recipe, can't wait to try it :))",
				"The cake is absolutely delicious! So indulgent (at least for me, I very rarely bake) - half of it is gone already and I'm doing Easter solo haha ;)I was wondering if you could give me advice whether I could tweak this recipe to make it almond flavoured? My grandma always bakes an almond babka for Easter and her recipe is looks difficult to veganise so I thought I could adapt your recipe since the texture is very similar. I was thinking of removing most of the lemon juice, zest and poppy seeds and replace it with more milk and add a few drops of almond flavourig (she adds that to her recipe) - does it sound like it could work? Your option would be much appreciated! :)",
				"Thank you for your tips, you're the best!! I made all the changes and it came out absolutely delicious and very close to what I remember my grandma's babka tasted like. The texture is so spot on! I wrote down the exact quantities and I'd be happy to share (although I did pretty much what I said in my previous post)",
				"Another amazing recipe. Absolutely delicious, light, simple and an easy crowd pleaser. Lasted a whole week in the tin and really moist. I added more zest and lowered the sugar a little as I love the tang. Thanks again!",
				"This is absolutely delicious and a doddle to make",
				"This recipe looks amazing! I was wondering - do you think it would work well with wholemeal flour and brown sugar? I know it would look totally different, but I only usually have panela sugar in the house!Thanks very much x",

				"I made this loaf for a family get together and it was delicious! I added the lemon syrup after baking but I think it made it a bit too sticky (I only added half but next time I\u2019d only add a quarter). Mine sunk in the middle a smidge like others have said but I didn\u2019t mind, it tasted delicious! Thanks!",

I used half the recipe and  got 5 muffins out of it (baked at roughly 18 minutes).  I like muffins as you can freeze them easily as well.  Haven't tried them yet but my bf loved them! Thanks for a easy recipe that doesn't require a ton of washing up",

It worked out very nicely, and gave it a different character, while still providing the crunch, and earthiness you'd like from the poppy seeds! It had a slight savory flavor that actually complimented the cake nicely!",
				"Thank you for sharing these amazing recipe with us, I cannot wait to prepare thjis amazing recipe and taste it myself and see how well it tasted and cooked also sharing it with my friends and family as well for their future reference.",
				"Just made this (without the icing) and love the flavor. I used coconut oil, plain, unsweetened soy milk, and granulated sugar (didn't have caster). I added about 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp salt. Mine only needed 40 minutes in the oven, but it's a gas oven from 1947 so the flames make for a different heat. Sadly, I didn't wait quite long enough for it to cool off before I tipped it out of the loaf pan, so it stuck and cracked. Still delicious! The subtly almond and coconut flavors, not too sweet, are delightful.",

				"Is there a reason you use flax/chia egg instead of just plantbased milk? I used ground up chia but it was too thick to stick to the tofu, and it just pushed away the flour when I tried to press it on, so I subbed it for oat milk. Still, delicious tofu \ud83d\ude0b We ate it in a poke bowl with soybeans, mango, pickled red onion, rice and avocado. Made a peanut based sauce to go on top of everything.  Thanks for posting!",
				"You have switched me onto tofu in a big way Ania! I love the option to marinade, then bake, then coat with sauce as per the peanut sate recipe but this is also a great way to eat tofu. I cut the tofu into small cubes as I love getting the fried/baked crunch. Sesame seeds are an awesome substitute for breadcrumbs as well. The flax seed coating worked really well. P.S. You photos of the meals are really spectacular!",
				"This was delicious, I subbed fried shallots for black sesame seed (I still wanted it to look pretty) and the flavours worked a treat!! The only thing I would say is that I found the tofu a tad bland in the middle however it may have been due to the thickness of my steaks; either way, a quick soy and sesame dipping sauce cleared that right up! Super easy and definitely looks gorgeous",
				"I love sesame seeds so think I was quite liberal with the amount I used. I also bought in black sesame seeds for this as you suggested using both and so glad I did it gave it something extra.",
				"We made these this evening and used more sesame seeds than stated but that's ok because sesame seeds rock! Also when frying they spat quite a bit so we decided to bake them, they weren't as golden as the few we fried but jwere crispy and ust as tasty. The marinade is yummy. Thanks for posting.",

I make batch cook these and freeze some to really make my efforts count. :) One thing I wanted to mention was that the second time I made these I decided to steam the whole cabbage and peel off leaves as they became softer instead of boiling a few leaves at a time.  I didn't blanch them but I didn't notice a difference in the final result and it was so much easier.",
				"Thank you for your reply! Yes, I was thinking that I would have to buy a very expensive camera. I was stagnating because I thought the first step was the find the perfect camera. But, I now realize I just gotta settle on one and just start practicing. So many things go into making a good photograph like lighting and editing....and how you arrange the food. The dousing the cabbage in cold water seems like a cool trick. I'll try it!",

The picture of you spooning a spoon of brown rice into the cabbage leaf was absolute perfection! I have never tried photography before. Just my iPhone camera. And, I can never get my pictures to look this tempting. What camera and lens do you use to get get such amazing shots? And, how do you make the cabbage look so vibrant green? Or, is it just the color of the natural cabbage?",

Not one to throw anything out, however, I unrolled each and scraped the mushroom/rice mixture into a saucepan. Added water to cover about an inch over the top and put on a medium heat. Then let it cook until rice was tender and water absorbed. It made the most delicious porridge that I ate over several days.  So good that I'm wondering how to replicate without going through all the cabbage roll steps!I ate the  green cabbage separately with a little mustard.",

				"Hi Ania, I don\u2019t know really anything about you and I am new to your blog. I was looking for cabbage rolls but after reading your comments I feel compelled to share.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, along with other health issues. When I became pregnant with my son all my symptoms worsened exponentially. Everyone tried to act as if it were perfectly normal to feel like hell when pregnant but I couldn\u2019t accept that. After trying just about every fad diet on the planet (all pushed even by my  \u2018alternative\u2019 ND and midwife) I simply prayed to The Universe in desperation for some kind of answer. Then  I \u2019accidentally\u2019 stumbled upon Medical Medium. After adapting my diet more and more to fit what he recommends I can say that not only do I feel fully recovered from my pregnancy but actually more healthful , vital and whole than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. You\u2019re already vegan so you\u2019re on the right track but there are some other trouble makers even in a vegan diet that can cause issues. Additionally there are specific cleanses and supplements that he outlines in a very detailed fashion to help address every single symptom under the sun. AND he actually explains why these different ingredients cause issues and why certain symptoms exist far beyond the current medical scope. If you are open to healing through a healthy diet of  plant based foods  then I would strongly encourage you to at  least check him out. And back to the topic, these look delish! I would also love to see a traditional recipe from your blog since it has so much yummy polish food already.  I will be subbing coconut aminos though for the soy as that is sadly on the list of trouble-makers. Wishing you the best. \ud83d\udc9a",
				"Hi Ania, I\u2019m glad to hear things are going well and hope your therapist is a great fit. I have been loathe to mention it as I know you try to be naturally healthy but from personal experience I can recommend Aropax for depression and  Lexapro for ongoing OCD or anxiety muffling. The former for just a while, the latter, in reduced dose as a daily maintenance .  I\u2019m sure you will want to explore all avenues but this is just a thought as they worked so well for me. PS i think you\u2019re a beautiful writer.. maybe there\u2019s a bookin this? Big hug. \ud83d\ude43\u2764\ufe0f",

				"What\u2019s the best vegan brunch meal",
				"Wow, really? I knew from reading some of your other posts that I recognized something about your way of presenting information. Turns out it is depression, which we have in common. It is such a personal issue, so I can relate to the worry of either writing too much or being disingenuous. But now you\u2019ve made me very curious about what it is you have discovered... haha. My greatest takeaways are always from stories, so I would love to maybe read yours at some point. I am fascinated by the unconscious ways we are drawn to others with similar issues. My trust in official therapy methods is quite low, because of their reductionism - I only found through my art that it was my induced conservative-right way of thinking that depressed me (having been raised on patriarchal interpretation of art and culture) which in itself was based on denying my sexuality and ancestral knowledge about it. So the way some people throw medication at you or tell you it is \u201ca physical illness\u201d then goes on top of those worries that \u201cthere might be something wrong with you\u201d (I did resist this idea, nevertheless) because you are intelligent and question things. It has been much, much better since my going vegan, because of the ethics involved - suddenly the anxiety just disappeared because there was no more hiding the lies I\u2019d been participating in. The depression still returns at times, but it is good to know it\u2019s an ongoing balance to be free of it, not a destination. Meaning that \u201cthe dark\u201d always compensates for something \u2014 we must remember to embrace it and the loneliness we run away from, because that is why we experience them as negative.",

				"I applaud young for sharing your difficulties. Many will share your experiences and be relieved that they are not alone. I have had many bouts of mental health issues which have taken a great deal of time and effort to overcome. But it\u2019s worth it and  I wish you all the very best.",

				"It takes a lot of courage to talk about issues that are so personal and I completely understand how you are feeling.  I too have struggled with depression all my life and when I was younger, I went to many therapists trying to get help. The last one I went to tried hypnotherapy with me and when he saw that it was not helping, he suggested that I try an antidepressant. I am not a fan of taking medications but he said something to me that made me reconsider. He said \"if you were a diabetic, would you refuse to take medication for your illness? Depression is a physical illness and if medication can help then you should give it a chance\". I did and it changed my life. The first pill he prescribed did nothing for me. The second kicked in after about 6 weeks and since them, I feel so much better. No more suicidal thoughts, no more feelings of lack of self-worth. I am not saying that it would be right for everyone, but it sure helped me. You might want to talk to your therapist about it. Best of luck to you and thank you for sharing your struggles. It always helps to know that you are not alone.",

Your mouthwatering recipes are a credit to you.  Like Cindy, I have found Dr Joe Dispenza and others like him an absolute godsend in my healing journey.  I\u2019ve no doubt you have and will continue to be drawn to the right person/s to assist you each step of the way. With much love (Aroha)Rosina",

				"Oh my goodness, only 40. As far as I\u2019m concerned you are ahead of the game. I\u2019m 49 and feel like I\u2019m just getting my baggage sorted. A wise therapist once pointed out to me that demonizing our past behaviors is not nearly as helpful as Honoring and appreciating them for getting us to where we are so we can then release them as they no longer serve us. I hope this might help you in your journey. Love and light to you.",
				"Hello Ania, I follow you and love your recipes. I've read your story and feel compel to share. I follow Dr. Joe Dispenza who was a chiropractor who broke his spine quite a few years ago now but healed. I know it sounds crazy. Anyway he now teaches workshops over the world, has written a couple of books, Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, and Becoming Supernatural and another Evolving Your Brain. It's basically guided meditations with changing your thoughts and feelings during the day. It's a lot to say in a message, but two nights ago I was watching some testimonials as they really keep me inspired (I am healing from an autoimmune issue). Here is the link to this lady Amy and it's a beautiful journey but obviously didn't start out that way. Maybe it will resonate with you.

I think having bananas in the batter makes for a great consistency, and mixing banana with the soda and acid (I chose apple cider vinegar) meant that the soda was well dissolved for sure! Great pancakes :)",

I'm in the US and couldn't find smoked tofu, so I substituted TVP [I used a half cup dry] with a few added spices [tamari, liquid smoke, blackstrap molasses, ground fennel, and nutritional yeast], though the additional spices shouldn't be strictly necessary.  I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry, which is accidentally vegan.  Even the non-vegans quite enjoyed them.",
				"Total winner of a recipe! I'm calling these \"Self-saucing sausage rolls\" as they were so moist and tasty I didn't need ketchup, and I am usually a ketchup fiend when it comes to these things.I made this with half white rice, half tofu (cos I had 1/2 cup of cooked rice in the fridge needing using up) and it worked a charm. I used nearly 3 large portobello mushrooms (which came to 250g - wow they're heavy!)I was worried the garlic would burn while I fried the mushrooms so I added it in just as soon as the water had come out of the mushrooms (assuming they will start to absorb flavours around  at this point)",

				"Lovely recipe - I\u2019ve made the rice version, and will be serving them tomorrow as part of a birthday buffet! Do you think they\u2019ll be safe to reheat tomorrow (with the rice) or would it be safer to serve them cold?  Thanks :)",
				"These are the most delicious vegan sausage rolls I've ever had. Wouldn't change a thing about them. Thanks for the recipe.",
				"These are so delicious! I made the rice version and the mix itself was super tasty, I could have eaten a lot of that by itself. I wasn't sure when to add the paprika, but added it with the worcestershire sauce/soy sauce etc. mix, hope that was right!The rolls made a lovely dinner with roast potatoes and veg, and we were able to resist eating the lot, so we now have a perfect lunch addition or snack. I may make these for dinner parties/potlucks. Thanks for the recipe, it has definitely lightened our lockdown :)",

My partner and I have had enough of paying our taxes to this right-wing government whose values are totally misaligned with ours, thus, we are hoping to move to NZ. Whatever you choose/ have chosen to do, I wish you all the best and hope you are happy. There are many Brits like us who are on your side but I bet it\u2019s hard to remember that. Best wishes,Meryl",

We migrated to Australia 25 years ago and have never been more relieved to be not living in Britain. Friends have been getting some hope by canvassing madly, and at least you don't feel so helpless.Good luck, and if all else fails, eat a plate of Florentines with a nice pot of tea!!",

I did not have any dried porcinis unfortunately so just had to rely on my  veggie broth and white wine.  I did use a splash of lemon juice instead of balsamic.  It still tasted  wonderful.

				"I made this for Christmas Day - it was my first time using silken tofu for a dessert which was exciting! I was surprised how custard like it was! It was perfect! I had a lot of trouble with the pastry though. When I refrigerated it, it just broke in pieces when I tried to roll it out. It seemed much better once I kneaded it all together again and when it was warmer but then of course it was very soft and difficult to put in the flan pan. I also blind baked it a lot longer than the recipe called for, but it still had a slightly gummy texture in the base, which I didn\u2019t like so not sure what I did there.But overall it was really tasty and I was inpressed! I will definitely be saving the recipe for future use \ud83d\ude00",
				"Oh I am so excited to try this recipe! I knew I had seen it somewhere made with silken tofu!  All others seem to use coconut cream and cashews or chickpeas and I just wasn\u2019t keen on that. I haven\u2019t heard of \u2018firm\u2019 silken tofu! Could it just simply be called silken tofu here? And how much pumpkins will I need to steam to equal to the amount in your recipe as I don\u2019t want to and can\u2019t use canned stuff here \ud83d\ude00",

I have shared it on a vegan sirte that I belong to so I hope that is OK with you.  Absolutely the BEST pastry I have ever made or eaten!! Thank you so much for your kind sharing.....The pumpkin part was lovely too by the way ......",

				"Thanks. Tasty. Tried them tonight before I had to give a talk. Ever so quick to make. Good use of the aquafaba in the fridge. Used salted peanut butter and no additional salt. Tried to speed and melt chocolate in the microwave but burnt the middle so I don't recommend that!! I used 2 large trays and they ended up looking like yours!",
				"Oh my goodness these were AMAZING.  My new favorite vegan cookie.  I didn't have almond flour so I subbed all purpose but only used 80grams instead of 100 so it would stay gooey and it worked fantastic.  My family all loved them.  We froze the extras and I think the best way to eat them is straight out of the freezer.  Oh and I used cashew butter intead of almond butter and it was fantastic.",
				"These were amazing! But mine didn\u2019t spread though and was wondering how did you achieve the flatten and lovely cracks in your cookies? \ud83d\ude0a thanks!",

				"Love these cookies. They are like a brownie in cookie form. I didn't have any  almond butter and used vegan chocolate spread instead.",
				"I'm not thur best bake in the world, made these but wondering if I've done something wrong? They still tasted nice but was a bit dry and they didn't flatten out.  Could it be 1) I didn't put quite enough aquafaba in, or 2) I didn't whisk it enough?   Also does it matter if I use smooth or crunchy nut butter?  Many thanks",
				"These are delicious and so chocolatey! I was a bit worried because I struggled to fold in the almond butter and ended up losing most of the volume of the aquafaba, but they came out perfectly with an amazing squidgy texture inside. They freeze and defrost well too. Thanks Ania!",
				"OMG these cookies are sooooo gooood..... and so easy to make. Thanks again for a great recipe....LiLo",

				"I made these and they're really nice. I had to make a chocolate bar to use for it as I had none in the house and to buy one would have taken me over budget this week - seemed kind of crazy, making the chocolate, setting it so that I could melt it again but I couldn't be sure what weight it would come out at!!!I was expecting them to spread so made the mistake of just leaving them in heaps on the baking tray - I'll know better next time!",

I am terrible at making gluten-free treats although I have a close family member who is gluten free loves and treats as much as we all do :) so these were a Godsend really. They were so quick to make and everyone loved them. Only change I made was left out a bit of the sugar. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These cookies are perfection! Your recipes deliver EVERY TIME! Thank you!!",
				"Hi there these look delicious! Can I ask what the chickpea brine is for? And what can I use as an alternative if I don\u2019t have any on hand right now?",
				"Can you replace the aquafaba with another egg replacement? I cannot have the brine of legumes.",
				"It looks really great. Can I do this? I am not sure. Thanks.",
				"Sooooo goood",
				"Sorry Anya, I know how it feels when you come out of something feeling a little taken advantage of. It leaves a sour taste.Question: If I don't have a chocolate bar on hand, do you think I could make this using cocoa powder? If not, I'll just wait till Monday to go buy some good vegan choc. I live in Greece and I know you know how it is.... got to wait for the Bio store to open :D",
				"Sorry to read about your experience. I was shaking my head as I was reading about the way they treated you and your home. You still managed to bake these delicious looking cookies though?? Amazing!Any chance I can still use regular all-purpose flour to make them nut-free? Allergies! They won\u2019t have the same delicious taste as almond flour, but as long as I won\u2019t mess them up completely... Thank you and I hope all your construction-next-times are positive and uplifting :)"

Oven baking the whole pieces of butternut saved me peeling time. After it cooked, just scooped out the squash. Everything ended up in my saut\u00e9 pan.  I added nutritional yeast and tahini for the finished dish served with sorghum pasta.  I found this recipe because I have surplus onions and just happened to also have a butternut in the bin. Thanks for such an inspiring recipe!",

				"I really don't know how you do it with these mixed pasta dish flavors. The nutritional yeast with the balsamic, the squash, the nuttiness from the whole wheat pasta...  it all comes together so nicely. I used baby spinach instead of kale, and mixed it in at the end until just wilted --delicious. This and the almond butter/pumpkin/miso pasta dish are both so unique and SO worth the effort. Thank you <3",
				"Tried this tonight and it was so yummy. I love making the caramelized onions on the same sheet pan as the squash. Due to the corona virus, I made some substitutions to avoid going to the store but the recipe is very adaptable. I used a yellow onion and frozen peas since I didn\u2019t have red onion or kale.

I skipped the red wine also bc of my daughter and used mushroom powder instead of the dried mushrooms, it's easier and quicker and as good.The idea with the minced chickpeas is great! We both liked your Shepherd's Pie so much and my daughter didn't know about the mushrooms, I didn't tell her, pssst.,. ; ) We heated up the remaining the next day and it was still good and delicious.Finally I have a recepy with mushrooms she will also eat because I love mushrooms!

I will use this sub in lots of other things now!! My version of this turned out so yummy! I despise mushrooms, so I left them out, altered to herbs to my taste (no nutmeg, no chili, and no sugar), subbed tomato sauce since I didn't have whole tomatoes, and added chopped kale and a layer of organic green peas on top before adding the mash. Also, to make this quick and lower cal, I used Bob's Red Mills potato flakes made with just water to make the mashed potatoes. IT IS SO GOOD and WILL BE A GOTO FROM NOW ON! Thank you!",
				"Any idea what the calorie count is please? Made this and it was yummy! Thank you",
				"This is excellent!I left out the red wine, used fresh tomatoes (peeled and chopped) instead of tinned (leaving out the date syrup/sugar, which I guess is there to balance the acidity of the tinned toms). I used brown lentils (Spanish, from a jar) instead of chickpeas. And I used plain mash, rather than the deluxe version given here, because I ran out of time.Result? Absolutely fabulous. I have several recipes for a vegetarian/vegan cottage pie - this is easily the best. Thanks Ania!",

I was honestly worried cause the sauce looked like some weird mess, but after it was baked everything settled into a neat and tasty dish. I skipped porcini and substituted red wine with white. Made potato mash with the water used to cook the potatoes (the best and most unpretentious way in my opinion; thanks granddad who taught me this trick) and vegan butter.

I used russet potatoes and 00 flour, and I guess I didn\u2019t use enough flour/knead enough, because my first batch did fray when boiling, as you mentioned. I kneaded more flour into my remaining dough (hadn\u2019t rolled this out yet) and while these were better, there was still room for improvement.. thankfully they weren\u2019t gummy, but they were almost too soft?! I may have made them slightly too large as well, so that probably didn\u2019t help! I\u2019ll have to try again, possibly with a different potato variety, or being a bit bolder with the flour and kneading... I was probably over-cautious!

				"Hi, I\u2019m a lover of oats for breakfast and this recipe sounds lovely. I\u2019m intrigued to know more about the dreaded processed oats as was unaware of these. How do I know a processed oat from a non-processed oat? I am aware that the \u2018instant porridge\u2019 type oats are rubbish but beyond that thought oats were oats, just rolled or porridge, both good. Thanks!",
				"Hi dear Ania,I live in England (West Yorkshire) now, and I find it difficult to have a decent vegan meal in a nice restaurant, not talking about breakfast... So I usually make my own. I love oats, I used to eat a lot of them, but I've got bored. Anyway, I believe this recipe would be perfect for me!  I love all the ingredients (yay for pecans!), mmm the fresh fruits! :)Thank you for sharing with us!All the best,SuziePS. I love your blog! ;)"

				"This was delicious! I was a bit apprehensive about the amount of peanut butter and whether it would dominate, but it went really well with the banana. Have also never done a recipe where the sugar is replace by maple syrup, but all worked well. I made it with gluten free flour and it is still moist which isn't always easy to achieve with gf flour. Would highly recommend.",

My husband has been eating vegan this past year and I am just beginning to experiment with vegan cooking.  This was my first baked good.  It turned out amazing!  Everyone in the house loved it.  The only thing I did differently was I added a little almond milk to the batter because mine came out a little dry.  I used the agave option.  It had just the right amount of sweetness!  100% will make again.",

Either way, will make them again because they are so delicious and I usually have all the ingredients at hand :)",

To be honest, I wasn't looking for a vegan recipe at first, 'cause I'm slightly afraid of vegan baking recipes, as they sometimes require specific things. However, I decided to search for a recipe on your website and when I found this one, I was like \"OMG, I have all the ingredients\", so I decided to use it.They came out pretty great for a first attempt, they are really tasty. They were just a bit salty (I blame the chocolate) and too crispy. So I wanted to know if you have a tip for them not to be too crispy. In which form you put them on the tray? (Like a ball, or thinner?)Hope I didn't annoy you with this anecdote and hope you're doing well during this time.",
				"Can we use plain flour or self raising flour instead of all purpose flour for the recipe",

I made these for a diary free and an allergic to loads of things audience so used gluten free flour and didn\u2019t add the nuts. I didn\u2019t use the cardamom either but did add some orange rind, which smelt delicious while cooking. They were loved by everyone! This is the second gluten free sweet recipe I\u2019ve tried from this site and they are both marvellous (I\u2018ve also made the gluten free raspberry brownies). What I love is that they are good recipes, producing beautiful sweet goodies in their own right. These aren\u2019t just \u2018good for vegan\u2019 or \u2018good for gluten free\u2019. They\u2019re just good! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe."

Just wondering if you have any seasoning tips? I've had a cast iron grill pan but no matter what I do I can't seem to get it to season properly, it is like it always gets sticky around the grill bits.

It wasn't easy back then, comparatively you have ir sooo good now, vegan dishes at most restaurants, all kinds of prepared foods available, which brings me to my point-I'm sure your recipe is delicious, but I'm not doing all of that work, I'm going to make do with some 'Tofutti' brand pseudo cream cheese.

It was not for me and we ate pounds of really good cheese a month; Jarlsberg on counter for snacking , always, and  several cheese and veggies loaded frittatas a week. (I baked a whole one, sans onion, for dog.)  I use soaked cashews for all kinds of cheese replacements. I'm a bit concerned about leaving this out for days. I live in the humid, hot tropics, basically in the jungle (a petri dish for all kinds of microbes in the air) with no very cool place to set the cheese while it is doing it's thing. The day time temps in house are  about 29C =  84F. I will be making the ricotta  cheese soon and will report back."

				"Hi Ania,I have been a long time visiter of your beautiful blog and have commented a few times on some recipes I made and enjoyed. This time I really wanted to let you know that I feel exactly the same way as you do about trying to make friends - you describe the difficulty of making new friends just how it is. Most people of my age (I am a bit older than you are) already have their life made in term of having a husband/life partner, maybe some kids, a nice house, at least one car, a career and a good circle of friends. Many people have a full agenda, no time for anything that is not planned in their busy schedule. And no interest in other people because it is already difficult enough to keep all their existing relationships active. Not having the luck of obtaining all, or at least some of these things, is sometimes difficult; I can't have a conversation about my kids, the new car I bought, the promotion I had or the parties I went to. Well, I know not everybody has that same life as I described it earlier, but sometimes it seems like they do - doesn't it?I just wanted to let you know you are not alone in feeling lonesome at times. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.As always, the recipe looks delicious.Best wishes,Yvonne",
				"Ania, Love your recipes, thank you. A thought regarding establishing new friendships.  Volunteer organizations always need people.  Clubs like Rotary that I also belong to are a fabulous way of meeting new people world wide (they have clubs globally and of course in Athens), and they do many worthwhile projects and community activities.  Good Luck and don't be shy.  Tom",

I don't do the maple syrup but I cut up a date and put it in for some sweetness and occasionally add some raisins too!

In the morning I love to top it off with fresh berries and homemade cinnamon almond butter... and don't forget a fresh cup of coffee to go along with them!Thanks for the recipe!",

				"Baked this today and unfortunately it turned out dry and just blah tasting. I did substitute whole wheat flour in so I wonder if that\u2019s what made it so much more dense?",
				"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe! I deeply appreciate how delicate the flavor is. I am a passionate home cook who has just started down the twisting and turning path of baking. I did not have almond flower so I halved the amount and used AP flour. I\u2019m guessing this is why my batter looked more like dough after combining the wet and dry? Thick and sticky with lots of texture. I\u2019d love an answer to that if you could confirm? With my snafu, the cake was more like a bread and had a 45 minute cook time. My fianc\u00e9 and I ate every crumb in 36 hours :)",

				"Hi, this recipe looks divine! I was wondering if it might be possible to use applesauce in place of the almond butter, or might that change the texture of the cake too much? Thanks!",
				"Dear Cat, I was wondering if you could clarify what you mean by ground almonds.  I'm in California and we have \"almond flour\" which is very fine but no ground almonds, so I'm not sure what the texture is supposed to be like for your cake.  The peaches, nectarines and plums are lusty and fragrant right now - this cake would be perfect to use up the bounty.   Thanks :)",
				"For the \"ground almonds\" - just how finely ground are these? Can one use almond flour? Thank you",
				"I noticed your recipe calls for Koko brand yogurt, peavh and passion fruit flavored. We don't have Koko brand yogurt here, sonim mot sure how thick it is. My usual is Silk plain, which is a little on the thinner side, unflavored and unsweetened. Do you recommend a flavored yogurt that is sweetened?  I sometimes use Silk vanilla which is of course vanilla flavored, and sweetened-but not exactly thick. Also, where do you find ground almonds?Thanks!!P.S. This recipe sounds yummy!!"

I'll probably do 1tsp next time. I also used garlic powder out of easiness. I think I'd bake next time to reduce amount of oil. They crisper us lovely in the oven after a fry in the pan.",

They held together nicely and cooked well in the oven but then I decided to fry them in a non stick pan to get a nice golden crunch. They tasted FABULOUS but we thought some crunchy texture would be nice. Any ideas on what could be added? Maybe some toasted pumpkin seeds or some kind of nut roughly chopped?

				"These were amazing! My husband, who isn't normally a huge fan of meatless dishes, loved this. Very flavorful and quick to make. I halved the recipe, substituted cilantro for the mint, and had to fry them on medium heat on my stovetop. I served it with a creamy cilantro mint dressing and it was superb.",
				"Loving your blog and instagram! I could never make these right! Do you think I can bake these without adding any oil?",

I have had one attempt at making vegan meringues and it wasn't great but you have inspired me to try again. The recipe I used before didn't have any lemon juice so maybe that was the problem.

There is nothing not to love about this dish as others have commented.

Light, refreshing, and at the same time like a warm hug. Can't reommend enough!",

I love lemongrass, but I had never cooked with it until now.I actually used soy curls instead of tofu just because I was making a cabbage and carrot slaw along with this that had tofu as well.

I guess that mixing liquid with chocolate isn't the best idea?As for the aquafaba - I knew it's ready because I could turn the bowl upside down and it stayed in place. After I mixed the chocolate, the \"magic\" of the aquafaba was lost, and even after I left it in the fridge, it turned into a drink...

It turned into a drink instead of a mousse! Even though it will never be a mousse, I tried to split the amount of chocolate into the cups. You have said that it should fit 4 cups. It's not enough even for one glass...  the fouth cup from the left has no chocolate at all. https://i.ibb.co/Qrj3wdC/IMAG0306.jpg",

				"\ud83d\ude43hi there. Some rime ago you mentioned you'd be plastering a lot. Probably too late (the rate at which you accomplish things) but  my husband's top tips, gathered from a lifetime of renovating our various homes) are: use Bondcre 1:4 with water prior to plastering. It's sticky and is good for helping marry the plaster to the old surface. Otherwise the old surface can suck the water out of the plaster mix.Use plasterer 's sand, not  brickies if mixing your own.Work quickly when applying.Rough textured surface, even slightly so, far easier than going for super smooth. What did the Victorians do, hopefully rough \u263a\ufe0fThere used to be a paint that had a rough surface and great colours but hell to get off if repainting.The consistency of the plaster should be like toothpaste.Apparently all this will mean nothing if you are using a plasterer ready mix bag. He says he was rendering not plastering as such though he did do it inside.Ps i did my fair share and have the hands to prove it \ud83d\ude0fI'm excited for you both, we always enjoyed transforming \ud83d\ude09",

Thanks for all the food inspo as well- Can't wait to try this recipe, hopefully, I'll be able to make it taste as good as it looks! :) xx",
				"Hi Ania, I can't wait to try this recipe. I just have one question.You mention: \"200 g / 7 oz melty vegan cheese, shredded or homemade cashew bechamel**\"If I choose to make the homemade b\u00e9chamel you mention in the other recipe, the ingredients of that recipe will give me the exact amount of sauce that I need for this recipe?Thanks. Tamas",
				"It is delicious! Thank you for this great recipe, I will cook it many times in the future :)",
				"Made this today and it won't be the last time!It's totally delicious. Gave some to my non vegan parents who also dislike sweet potato and they raved about it so had a full portion for their dinner!Served it with coconut collaboration yoghurt and avocado, amazing combo, would never have thought it would work but it does .Coconut collaborative yoghurt is a yummy new find thanks to you.I don't have a mandolin, cut the sweet  potatoes by hand and they were cooked perfectly, more to do with my very sharp knife than my cutting skills I think!!!This is the first of your recipes I've cooked , most definitely won't be the last.Thank you so much \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude38",
				"This is delicious. I'm not vegan, I'm vegetarian, so I used real cheese and sour cream and it was fantastic. I'm sorry if I offended anyone. I love your recipes.",
				"Great recipe! I loved it  <3",
				"Hi Ania, what if I wanted to use fresh tomatoes to make the sauce,how much would I need? And would I also use the same quantitty of water as in the recipe? Thanks!",
				"I'm so glad to hear you're liking your new house! My fianc\u00e9 and I just moved a few months ago ourselves, and it's been really nice setting down our roots :)",
				"Can't wait to try!  Sweet potato slice  thickness?  1/4 inch?  No settings on my mandoline. Good luck with the remodeling!"

I also tried using olive oil instead of coconut oil and I prefer them,  it gives it more of a crunch. I also cooked it for about 25 minutes, so I changed it up a bit but definitely a regular in the household! Thankyou\ud83d\ude0b",

I used  320 ml of almond milk as in the recipe, but after resting in the fridge for 20 minutes the dough was still too wet. I'm a beginner at baking and l would like to ask you a few questions. Is m\u0105ka tortowa, typ 450, ok for this recipe? And should the coconut oil be chilled  before adding it to the dough?  And the last one, what consistency am l looking for? I'll try to make the scones tomorrow  again, wish me luck! :-)",

				"Hello Ania!Thank you for this recipe. The scones are fantadtic. My British friend said they reminded him of his childhood and that must mean something, right?  :) I didn't have a round cookie cutter, so I just sliced them with a knife. All my friends approved of the result! All the best, Paulina",

Thank you!I\u2019m making my daughter\u2019s birthday tea party (first time ever baking scones) and tried out 5 different recipes until only with yours, the scones came out the way they look in pictures and oh how delicious!. Fantastic! Thank you so much!Best,Natasha",

I will definitely be making them many times again, they're just the perfect treat or snack and go amazing with a cup of tea.I personally topped mine with jam and some vegan butter- absolutely delicious.Thank you for your wonderful recipe :)",

				"Hi Ania. I used to love the way the Brits welcomed all sorts of diversity and I thought of that as one of our best national traits. I feel  ashamed of my own people now, especially as I am a foreigner where I live but the treatment I\u2019ve had from the French has been so much more positive, which really highlights my own country\u2019s bad behaviour. Much as I sympathize with you, however, I must tell you I am firmly on the side of Cornwall as far as scones go!",
				"hey, i was wondering if i can also just cut circles with a knife as i don't have  a cookie cutter?",
				"Hi Ania, thank you for the recipe (this one and all the others). My scones are in the oven now . I had a hard time getting the dough to hold together (keeping in mind to not over work it) . Fingers crossed. Happy Easter !",

I have made literally hundreds of regular scones due to my catering career and was interested to see how your vegan recipe would work as a comparison. My boyfriend is vegan and I have also chosen to live a vegan life but  Often found vegan cakes, biscuits and scones disappointing. However, your recipe works so well you wouldn\u2019t know the difference. Thank you so much for making this recipe available so we can all enjoy delicious scones any time",

The dough was so fluffy, upon pressing the cutter down, you hear a sudden 'woooof' of air.I substituted:Dough - Coconut oil for Connect Foods, Buttery Spread with probiotics Glaze - Light Olive OilI live in Australia NSW, the butter was bought from Woolworths supermarket.Thank you for sharing (with the world) the best scone recipe.",
				"Hello Ania,I\u2019m definitely going to have a go at making these this afternoon. I can\u2019t wait for the smell to fill the house!I moved from Cornwall to Australia nearly 40 years ago where I have mostly fitted in and been accepted as an \u2018Aussie\u2019. What I find remarkable is that the racism in this country is often directed at our indigenous people, the original inhabitants of this country!! Racism is up there with hatred, jealously, greed, etc, and it\u2019s caused by fear. Where I\u2019m going with this is- don\u2019t let anyone offload their fear on to you. It\u2019s theirs to deal with. Rise above it, and send them healing, loving thoughts. And I will send you healing, loving thoughts! xxx",

				"Definitely cream first! As a commenter previously mentioned, it's way too hard to spread the cream on top of the jam :p  this whole argument is like when people debate whether the milk or the cereal goes into the bowl first.",
				"These look delicious! Scones are my Mum's go to for if she's got to take something to an event, they're always a crowd pleaser. I'm from Hampshire but in my house it's always jam on first, just because we've found you can get more topping that way ;) There's also the debate of pronunciation, we've always pronounces it like \"stone\" but my brother's gone to uni in Oxford and has come home saying scone like \"gone\" like an alien! Funny how culture can differ even in one country. I'm so sorry for your awful experience. I'm furious with Brexit and, quite frankly, the whole world. We all live on one planet for crying out loud so why can't we just all show a little compassion and consideration towards others.",
				"Just want to say how much I love your recipes! I\u2019ve been vegan for about a year now and they are my absolute \u2018go to\u2019 when I\u2019m trying to decide what to cook. They always work, not all vegan ( or non vegan for that matter) can be relied upon, yours however never fail! Thank you!Also I\u2019m so sorry for your experience with the racist plasterer, I hate this brexit Britain attitude that seems to be becoming exceptable . I am British but have never been so ashamed to admit it. Hang in there !Hope the house goes well.Definitely cream on the bottom!Tanya xxx",
				"Can I use vegan butter instead of the coconut oil?",
				"Just to say I haven\u2019t tried the scones recipe yet but I am very sorry that you had such a bad experience with the ignorant  plasterer. Makes me ashamed of what\u2019s happening to us all.",
				"Can't wait to try this! And it's jam first too :)",
				"Hi  I have just read your  post on scones. I just wanted to say that I am English from Devon.   I love the   diversity we have in this country  and I am appalled by what is going on in this country due to brexit. I hope you don't let the small minority in this country  get to you.  We are an island nation and we should welcome one and all regardless of creed or  race.  Anyway  back to the scones I will have a go at them with some gluten free flour.  Anyway good luck with the plastering and keep up the good work.",
				"I'm with you Ania on this one. Definitely easier if you put the cream on first as you can spread it. Once you've put the jam on, it's very hard to spread the cream around without the jam moving as well.",
				"No... definitely jam first!"

				"Hi I was going to make this recipe but I\u2019m so confused by the measurements for the sweet potato?? Why does it say 200g of uncooked sweet potato but then switch to cups for the cooked and mashed measurement? How much sweet potato should I use?",

				"Hi Ania, I just tried to make the cake. It's cooling down right at this moment haha. However, I hesitated a lot with the quantity of the sweet potato. In total, is it one sweet potato of 200 g? You say to add 1/2 cup of S. potato (which is 64 g I guess) And I didn't know what to do with the rest. Could you explain me a little bit? Cheers",

				"Hi  could I use steamed potato instead of baked?",
				"I made this recipe twice by now and every time it come out just perfect. I am making into muffins though.This time I added some chopped up apples and it was even moister. It always is a hit. I love your recipes and have tried quite a lot already. I also love that beet root hummus. It is out of this world. Thank you for the effort you put into this so we can have delicious food.Blessings",
				"I'm usually sceptical when people say that no one realised it was a 'healthy' recipe but in this case it's actually true! I made it in a larger pan so it came out flatter & so moist that I just called them brownies & they're one of my favourite ever brownies that I've made! I agree with several comments that the bake time might need to be a bit longer, but then as I used a different size tin I was expecting to adjust the bake time anyway!",
				"Thanks for sharing this recipe!. I made them into cupcakes, I used tahini instead of nut butter because my kids have nut allergy. I did add 1tbsp of apple cider vinegar just to be sure it could rise. The result was amazing, so moist and fluffy, absolutely will be part of my favourite vegan cakes. Also the frosting is delicious!",
				"Hi Ania,I had some leftover sweet potato, so I baked this cake yesterday for my partner who needed a sweet treat. It was delicious! The hazelnut butter made it  smell and taste incredibly. Thanks for so many great recipes!Paula",
				"Do you take the skin off of the sweet potato?",
				"Sounds yummy!!  Wondering... if I substituted honey or pure maple syrup for 1/2 the coconut sugar, what adjustment might I need to make in order for the cake to not be too wet inside?",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks for your response! I used caster sugar for this recipe so I'm guessing it's my oven - I've noticed it doesn't bake very evenly and just isn't very reliable in general so probably nothing to do with your recipe. I was still very happy with the result and will try again :)",
				"A lovely recipe, definitely my favourite vegan chocolate cake as others taste of soda too much. The texture of this is lovely too. I have to admit though, I didn't read the recipe properly and I boiled my potato instead of roasting it so I don't know if it would be even better when roasted. Thankyou for sharing x",
				"OMG I made these into cupcakes. These are delicious, especially if you heat them up a little in the microwave. YUM!!!",
				"Hi Ania,This looks amazing and I want to give this a try ASAP . Is there  ang alternatives to the almond or hazelnut butter as I have a slight nut allergy ?Thank  you!",
				"Hi Ania! I made this cake today and think the sweet potato is a beautiful idea and works perfectly for the texture of the cake as well as for the icing. I stuck to the original recipe but had to bake it quite a bit longer (90 minutes) until it was baked through. The crumb is really nice and moist but the cake has somewhat of a tough, chewy crust. I noticed that many vegan cakes  I've made recently turned out this way and I'm wondering if this has to do with my oven or if that's just a characteristic of a vegan cake...? I'd appreciate your advice / opinion! Otherwise, great flavour and texture - I will make it again!",
				"Thanks Ania! I left out the nut butter completely and used maple syrup instead of sugar. So I definitely made it too wet then - whoops! Great to know about the cacao and baking soda! The flavour of the cake is gorgeous.",
				"Hi Anya - I absolutely love your recipes !!! Is lemon or apple cider vinegar needed to activate the baking soda? I made this cake last night and the mixture was thick and was baking over an hour and still not cooked through. I didn\u2019t use nut butter and maple syrup instead so maybe that\u2019s why..",
				"I baked this yesterday and its amazing, the crumb of the cake is just so moist, I was a bit hesitant about the fristing with the sweet potatoe but it works. The changes I made was I added three quarters of a cup of raw sugar, and added my little secret (to ensure a nice moist cake) a teaspoon of vegetable glycerine, a French pastrychef gave this tip to my Mum years aga and it works a treat. If appears that Claudia's over maybe not working properly, I baked mine at 165 degrees celsius and it took just over an hour",
				"My bread is raw from the center and has been in the oven for more than an hour. :(",

Question though, any chance you'd be able to include (if not all nutritional facts) then at least the CALORIE count for total meal? That way I could do more of your recipes but we're trying to keep an eye on calories given we are these days home bound due to the lockdown in the UK and of course we are not as active as usually so have to be a bit more careful with how much we indulge in food and your delicious inspirations.

The depth of flavor was shocking and I know it's only going to get better the longer it sits.  I used 4 serrano peppers (no seeds), which was way too spicy for my boyfriend, but was able to bring the heat level down by adding more coconut milk and rice.  I'll definitely make this again, but if anyone has suggestions on peppers with a similar flavor but much less heat, I would appreciate it.",
				"Cze\u015b\u0107 Ania! Thank you so much! I've only just been put on a vegan diet due to health reasons and was dreading the change until my sister introduced me to your recipes. I made the green curry and sweet potato and black bean bake. I was dubious at first and expected the food to be bland and flavourless. I have been converted! The green curry is one the best I've ever had in my life, full of punchy flavour, spice and tang! Absolutely fantastic. I'll be making a double batch of the paste next time and plan to always have some stashed in the fridge. The bake is fantastic also, never thought that vegan cheese could be so good. I'm looking forward to trying your other recipes, next on my list is the Laksa and pierogi. Can't wait. Thanks Again!CheersKuba",
				"This was a very tasty and easy recipe. I left out the tamari/soy source and  used some different veg like bell peppers, mini corn cob etc. so defiantly worth doing again.",
				"I sadly couldn't find them at my local supermarket, but I will keep looking out for them. I'm curious to see what they taste like! Also, a great excuse to make this curry again. Not that I need one. :)",
				"Made this without keffir and without blender, just chopped the ingredients really finely. I put a few strips of lemon zest in, left them in too long so the curry ended up quite bitter. Still, it was so tasty and it's so nice to use fresh herbs. Thank you!",
				"Any ideas of what to substitute if I can\u2019t get any lime leaves?  Looking forward to making this!",

But anyway - thank you for your detailed response and all the tips!I'm just now in the process of translating various recipes for the chef and I think your Christmas roast wellington from last year would be ideal in terms of attainability of ingredients and it sounds like a delicious recipe even though I haven't tried it, I might make it this week - would it be okay for me to give the chef your recipe?Ordering some vegan sushi for the buffet could actually be a great idea...!

				"Just need to clarify, is it 2 tbsp oil for the paste, and another 2 tbsp oil for frying the paste?And also it's the white part of the lemongrass that is for blending into paste?Thanks! Looking forward to trying it out! :)~",
				"I don't usually leave comments on blogs like this, but I just have to say that this is phenomenal. Possibly one of the best things I've ever made. Thank you so much for taking all the time to make this recipe both vegan and perfect!",
				"I've never made a laksa before, let alone a vegan one, so I went into this with low expectations which were totally blown away! I think this recipe does a really good job at hitting very close to that authentic laksa soup flavour. It's a bit of a process to put together if you've never made it before (I'm sure I'll do better next time), but it turned out way better than I was expecting and was really enjoyable.Thanks so much for the recipe. xx",
				"I made this last week and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it ever since - hands down the best meal I\u2019ve ever made so thank you!!! The flavours are jsut so perfectly balanced. I was so in love with it I decided to make it again tonight but it lacked the same creamy velvety consistency  and  after much head scratching I realised it had to be the brand of coconut milk - so word of caution: not all coconut milks are created equal. Here in Aus you can get \u2018lite\u2019 or \u2018premium\u2019 coconut milk and between the brands of the \u2018premium\u2019 variety the fat content varies from 12-23%/100 grams and 40-90% pure coconut content - so be sure to get the fattiest , most coconut filled version you can find otherwise it ends up far too liquidy and spicy. Also here we call green/spring onions shallots so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been using for the paste (which has still turned out great!!) \ud83d\ude02 but excited to go buy some actual \u2018shallots\u2019 next time. Aside from my now thorough education on the discrepancies of coconut milk - I love using vermicelli in place of thicker rice noodles!!",
				"We had this laksa at the weekend and it was genuinely delicious!! Definitely adding this to our regular rotation of meals :) so yum xxx",
				"What an amazing recipe! Easy to find ingredients and easy to follow. I messed up by putting the dried spices in with the food processor blend but it still came out full of flavour. I can\u2019t wait to make this again, thank you :)",
				"This is my favourite vegan laksa recipe and I use it a lot! It's the closest recipe I've found to the bowls of laksa I had in Malaysia. I often add kafir lime leaves, crunchy noodles and Thai pickled greens and also eat this as a laksa/Khao soi hybrid and it's great.",
				"This was SO good!!!",
				"I absolutely loved this recipe! I followed it to the letter and it was just perfect! The spices really came through. The recipe was very easy to follow, so no stress in the kitchen. And I finally had an excuse to try pak choi for the first time! Thank you for sharing x",
				"Love this, made it tonight and so yummy! Added some fish sauce as I'm not vegan which was really nice.",
				"Wow! I made this exactly as set out here and I have to say it came out beautifully!!",
				"Hi :) love this recipeHow long can the paste be kept in the fridge xx",
				"I made this with store bought curry paste and added fresh lemon grass, chili flakes, garlic and some frozen lime leaves to the broth. And topped it with steamed broccoli, cilantro, spring onion and pan fried tofu, it was so delicious!",
				"I hope I can use the mandarine zest instead of lemongrass stalks.And happy to see your page since I've been desparating to seek vegan laksa recipe!Thanks for sharing your idea Ania :)",
				"Amazing and fresh with punch!  Made this tonight and it was my favourite laksa recipe.",
				"This recipe is amazing! The broth is so flavourful. Highly recommend to everyone! Would omit some of the chillies though if your not keen on food being quite spicy \ud83d\ude0a",
				"This recipe was so yummy! I made it the \u201clazy\u201d way with store bought vegan red curry paste, so I can\u2019t wait to make the laksa paste as per the recipe next time. Such a great recipe to use up some fridge veg - I added some mushrooms, julienned peppers and carrot ribbons as well as the greens!",
				"Oh no I accidently put the dry spices into the paste when I blitzed it up, do you think this will matter too much??  Or should I start over? Thanks : )",
				"yes thanks for the quick reply",
				"hello im confused about the paste do i blend the white or non-white parts of the lemongrass? this looks delicously and I cant wait to make it.",
				"I made this for dinner tonight and it was very delicious! Thank you for your recipe.",
				"Absolutely phenomenal recipe! Just made it for my boyfriend and his parents for dinner and they all said it tasted amazing!",
				"Very nice",
				"Hi there! This recipe sounds so delicious! I cannot wait to give it a try! I know this may sound a bit weird but Is there a way to make the sauce a bit thicker? I really like a thick sauce/ broth lol! Thank you!",
				"Really tasty and satisfying to make and eat!I\u2019m very grateful for this recipe, it\u2019s my go to when I\u2019m feeling run down!",
				"Made this tonight and it was a family favourite. I read another comment on the recipe about not adding the nori and I agree, it isnt really needed but I also did try it with nori and it was still lovely.",
				"I just made this last night and it was amazing. Thanks so much for the recipe!!",
				"Wow. Just made this and wow! No lemongrass or lime on hand but still yum!! Sadly nothing interesting to put in it other than ramen and tofu.",
				"My paste ended up being really bitter; any thoughts on why that would be? I ended up diluting it by adding more sugar, salt, and water, but I would've loved to have kept more of the original flavor.",
				"Looks gorge! Can you freeze it with all its toppings?",
				"Sounds delicious! Do you know how money calories per serving this has? :)",
				"If you\u2019re looking for the best Laska recipe,  just stop and make this one. This was SO GOOD! The flavor was exactly what I wanted- I was not expecting this to be as amazing as it was ( in a good way!) Awesome recipe. I\u2019ve been making curries for years, and this one is the best by far. My small changes- I used spaghetti squash instead of noodles ( I cooked it separately, I didn\u2019t want them getting soggy) I used kombu instead of nori, added  it with the extra lemongrass pieces and took them out at the same time, too. Next time I\u2019ll roast some cashews to add to the toppings. This recipe is bookmarked! Thanks Ania! Excited to see what other recipes you have on here!",
				"This looks delicious. Here in Australia I have been using vegan fish sauce which would be perfect to supply that  flavour you\u2019re looking for. I found it in the local Asian food store. You should surely be able to find it in the UK.Anyway lovely recipes and always beautifully styles",
				"Just wanted to say that I'm also up for a record breaking amount of dental treatments in Krakow in February which I\u2019m not looking forward to :(This recipe looks lovely - I might make it today!",
				"Hi Satya and AniaHave you considered putting the ingredients into some app such as MyfitnessPal as this will often give you the breakdown. I manually add into Recipes, putting in the number of portions I expect to get",
				"Hello Ania,I love your recipe's simple or elaborate doesn't bother me, you are amazing and give us such amazing concoctions. I was wondering if you would consider breaking down some of the nutritional values in your creations, I have a problem in that I am diabetic and need to count for instance both calories and carbs, in order to dose my meds with.  Otherwise I have to just shoot from the hip and guess.  The laska soup looks amazing and I have to be careful to get a reasonable amount of carbs because my body uses this for energy, and takes energy from my muscles, while I have this challenge.I count my calories because I am gradually cutting them to a healthy level for weight loss which helps me eventually overcome the diabetes, as I am type 2.I do understand it could be hard to do this and I would do it, only I don't know how to begin getting the nutritional values, maybe if you know you could direct me to finding out how to do that, if this would not suit your schedule, I know I am asking a lot, and it's time consuming.Thank you for your consideration xoxoxSatya",
				"OMG, outstanding!!!! We served it with lime wedges as well as all the other suggested toppings, and also offered chili garlic sauce :-) completely, amazingly perfect! PS, we left out the nori, we felt it really wasn't needed but would probably also be great with it!",
				"Hi Ania, \ud83d\udc89hope they're giving you plenty of local anaesthetic! Is the Polish NHS better than Britains's?",
				"Hi Ania Me again lol. I made your wellington at Christmas. Very good I fancy making this creamy  laksa but I don\u2019t like coconut. Could I replace the coconut milk with yoghurt do you think? Many thanks Julie",

This recipe is a delight...smoky, bright, crunchy, comforting. My husband dislikes olives (the horror) so I substituted roasted red peppers. Still, divine.  Thank you for the nourishing yet interesting recipes!",

				"I've been following your blog for the past month or so and I've made several of your recipes. I had this one for dinner tonight and it was so, so good! We used pearl barley, and tossed carrots and potatoes in paprika because I've never seen harissa. Also put some of Ikea's veggie balls on top. Absolutely phenomenal. The pomegranate seeds and olives were perfect in the dish. Thanks again!",

				"I appreciate your thoughts. Speaking out is one of the critical steps to resisting the hate. I have been reading articles on the murder and your thoughts give context. The world is a scary place right now. And the best we can do is hold on to our values, and resist where and how we can. For many reasons being a vegan is a good statement of values. So here is to changing the world one Buddha bowl at a time. I am looking forward to trying your recipe! It looks wonderful!"

				"Thank you for this recipe! I've been intimidated making a vegan version of this until I came across your recipe and could taste everything coming together nicely after reading the ingredients. Unfortunately I was missing a ton of ingredients but thankfully had decent subs available in my kitchen to scrap this together (no thanks to the quarantine and limited shopping) . Just a warning, you'll have a good laugh at all the subs but this totally turned out!!! We have to use what we have right?? So, I just ran out of tempeh.. :'(tempeh -> 1:1 Tofu: Impossible Beefshallots -> half small red onionlime juice -> old lemon juice that's still good but not as good as fresh lime (tasted a tad bitter) + rice wine vinegartamari -> 1:1 low sodium soy sauce: vegan hoisin saucecoconut sugar -> \"premium sugar\" that was light brown colored brought back from Japan. The label is all in Japanese. It's mild in taste like coconut sugar and all I have left in the pantry sitting next to dates....oil: coconut oilThanks to your ratios, the savory, tangy and sweet balanced out perfectly, which is  key! If it weren't for my fresh herbs, I don't think I could have pulled this off to satisfy my laab craving. I look forward to making this again another time with the actual ingredients you have listed! Thank you!!",
				"Hi Ania, I have been vegan for 5 years.  I cook extensively and am frequently trying new recipes.  I have cooked a number of great recipes from your site, all of which have been great.  This vegan larb recipe is  exceptionally good.   It has a great texture and flavor.  The browned rice gives it a wonderful crunch and flavor.  It is definitely going into my permanent vegan collection of recipes.  Thank you",
				"We made this laab today! Thank you so much - it was really superb! Substituted lemon juice for lime and maple syrup for sugar. Also served it with raw courgetti tossed in lemon juice, salt and oil.It transported us back to happy holidays in Laos visiting our daughter who lived there for a couple of years. Will be following you closely from now on! xx",
				"This looks delicious, I love Thai food. But could I use tofu rather than tempeh? I can't stand the stuff. Thanks  :)",
				"Thank you, this was so good! It was also surprisingly straightforward, when I first read the recipe I thought it seemed like it would require more time than it did. Thank you so much, the flavours are really great, this will definitely become a regular use for tempeh in my house.",

I think it is because of the acidity in the tomatoes seizing them up, combined with the particulars of my tap water. I was wondering if you could suggest how to modify the recipe so the raw lentils aren't added with tomatoes. Thanks!"

I wouldn't have opened and read it if I had known that it uses weird things like aquafaba and vegan chocolate. The picture looks quite yummie, but then I had to find that the recipe is only for food activists or... aliens, not for normal, healthy people!!",

I definitely loved it and will be making it again!I recommend that if making it for the first time for a big group, is safer not to use the Amaretto.Really easy to make and the base is delicious, made cookies with the leftover dough.",

I have used scales for the recipe as recommended in one of the other posts. Any idea what I can do to save this dough? Would adding more of the wet mixture help? And does the wet mix need to be smooth in appearance or is it okay that it has texture (grainy)? Thanks!",

Unfortunately I had following problems, which I hope you can give tips to overcome the next time:) The base after taking out of the fridge and being left to get to room temperature seemed very dry and hard to roll out. During baking, as soon as the parchment with beans has been removed the base all cracked (perhaps the oven heath's up more than set up?). After baking it turn out to be kind of chewy?I had also problem with the filling, which didn't want to set, even with a blast in the freezer - did set some, but not enough to comfortably slice the cake). - What am I doing wrong? Any suggestions how to over come those issues?I should probably mention that I'm not new to baking and as with all new recipes, I have followed it to a t.I look forward hearing from you.Best regardsMal",

I didn\u2019t have time to do the crust so I used a ready made pecan crust, but next time might try making it like a graham cracker crust but with gingerbread cookie crumbs (or ginger snaps), though the crust recipe looks delicious. Seriously, this is my new favorite pie EVER! It is soooo good, especially if you like dark chocolate and amaretto. MMMMM!",

				"This is an AMAZING recipe! I love the combination of gingerbread and chocolate, and was very intrigued by how it would work with amaretto. It\u2019s a wonderful combination of flavors. My non-vegan family loved it, too. I made the recipe as written with just a few adjustments due to my intolerances: gluten-free flour, flax egg instead of aquafaba, no nutmeg, and oat creamer in place of both the coconut cream and almond milk. I also warmed the oat creamer and mixed in the amaretto and maple syrup (to gently warm) to make sure my chocolate didn\u2019t seize. I added fresh cranberries and candied orange slices on top as decoration. I usually have a terrible time with gluten-free crusts, but this one actually worked incredibly well\u2014zero issues! I have dough leftover from the crust and am very excited to make gingerbread cookies with it. Thank you so much for this recipe!",
				"Good lord! I made this dessert for our Xmas dinner today and it was a huge success! Delicious, indulgent, the base is so crisp....it was very straightened to make in essence, you just need patience to allow things to chill, to melt slowly etc so it needed planning in terms of when I started it. We\u2019re not fully vegan in our house, my daughter has a cows milk allergy which led to me also giving up all dairy but I hate for her to feel left out or to have things she can\u2019t eat so wanted a dessert for everyone. We\u2019ll be making it again for sure!  Thank you thank you!",
				"Absolutely delicious tart! This is my 2nd time making it and upon closer reading of the instructions I have a question about the baking step. So I bake the tart with the parchment and beans for 10 minutes, but step 11 says after 15 minutes remove the paper and beans and return to the oven. So do I initially bake for 10 or 15? Is the 15 minutes in step 11 needed to rest the tart before returning to the oven?Thanks for your help!",

Maybe the fridge will help but will I be then able to leave it at a room temperature for some time without risking its melting? Or do you have an idea how to make it thicker? Thank you so much, it is such an inspiring recipe!",

				"I made this for our main Xmas meal last year and will be making it again this year. It is honestly DELICIOUS and goes down as a huge crowd pleaser with my non vegan family. Very easy to make and super yummy.",
				"Hi I am making this for the big day this year and looking forward to it! My question is- how far in advance can I make it? I would ideally like to make before Xmas eve if possible as I\u2019ll be busy that day and also don\u2019t want too much to do Xmas day. You mention you can make the beet filling and the mushrooms in advance, could I do as early as 22nd Dec, then assemble on 24th and cook on 25th? Thank you! Rachel",
				"Hi AniaThis is going to be my vegan xmas dish this Christmas after reading your recipe and the reviews - so just prepping my shopping list now for it. Looks and sounds delicious. Could you just clarify though - is the beetroot required for the gravy  uncooked ?  I know for the beet mixer its already baked but just want to get it right for the gravy - thanks so much  Sophie",
				"Superb taste and quite easy to make! You'll need to plan ahead but the instructions are very easy to follow and pretty straight forward. A holiday favourite I make for a second year in a row and have convinced others to make too!",
				"Delicious ! Great for Christmas dinner. I also gave some of this to my father in law on Christmas day who is a proper meat and potato guy and not keen on anything a bit different but he really liked it so an all round pleaser. We'll be doing it again this year :)",
				"Hi Ania, I am keen to try this but have a couple of questions?1 - unfortunately I am intolerant to mushrooms. Could you suggest an alternative?2 - Would it be possible to do this without the pastry as I am struggling with pastry content at the moment?Thanks",
				"Hi Ania, This really recipe is the main part of the menu that I have come up with for a pre-Christmas dinner in 2 days time. I really like how it has something more than just simply 'a whole beetroot' as it's centre, like many other recipes. I am expecting to have it all prepped tomorrow, except, I cannot find smoked tofu anywhere. Other than a couple of years ago trying to make somewhat of a disasterous cheesecake with tofu, I have not cooked with it and I don't usually eat it either. In fact, I really don't know one type of Tofu from the next. Can you please tell me whether the other flavours are strong enough to carry the recipe with a plain Tofu, or do I need reassess? I'm hoping time difference allows you to see this before I need to get cooking. Thank you",
				"Hi Ania, please tell me if I can freeze this gorgeous Wellington in its pastry?",
				"HI! This looks amazing :-)Do you think it could be prepped the day before and left in the fridge till baking?Thank you!",
				"Made this last night. Ah man the flavours are insanely good. Two questions though: Any ideas why the beet meat part wasn't as red as yours? (I added in about 20% more beet than suggested) And it wasn't as firm to shape as yours was, it kind of spread out in the oven. Any ideas? Otherwise 10 out of 10 forks on the taste meter.",
				"Hi! Thanks so much for replying :) . I did use vacuum-sealed, so that explains it. I'll use your recipe amount this time so it holds together like yours does.. Thanks so much again, about to make it now for Christmas dinner",
				"Made this last Christmas after looking at loads of recipes and it was so good going to make it again this year!  Really lovely flavours with smoked tofu, beets and mushroom.   Looks really impressive but is actually really straightforward to make.  Thank you for sharing the recipe x",
				"My go-to for all fancy/special occasion roast dinners, and sometimes mid-week in the winter too \ud83d\ude0dThe first couple of times I made it without the walnuts and then the third time I added them - Just wow! You gotta add them if you have them in your pantry! I haven\u2019t found Vegan Puff anywhere near me so I make my own shortcrust pastry and wrap it in that. It works perfectly! Easily my favourite vegan recipe ever \ud83d\udc95",
				"I made this last year (Xmas 2020) and it was a winner. It's fun to make, looks fantastic on the table both before and after cutting it, and the taste is out of this world, especially the light-handed smokiness from the tofu.We're having it again this year, so I've already made the beetroot mix and the mushroom mix and they're in the freezer, so all I'll have to do on the day is assemble it all. Thank you so much for such a lovely recipe.",
				"This will be our 3rd year making this! It is SO delicious! I do have a question, though. I\u2019m wondering if you can prepare and freeze the tofu \u201clog\u201d in advance. Then thaw it in the fridge and prepare the rest of it the day of. Thanks for such an amazing recipe!!",
				"HI Jenae, Ive made both the mixes in advance but kept them separate in the freezer. I don't know if that will make any difference but I didn't want to risk the two mixes mushing into each other as/after they're defrosted..",
				"Hi Ania, I have a question, I really want to cook a vegan mushroom wellington for christmas but I was wondering, which would be better refill : tofu, seitan or tempeh? I never tried any of these for the moment and I m really looking for a \"meat\" taste, kinda shawarma refill... Could you help me?! My Christmas menu will definetly be based on your recipies... Thx for sharing.",
				"Thank you for this recipe. Made it for my small group of dear friends and we all just LOVED it! It was worth all the work and you made it so clear who to do it. This one will be on our Dutch table again, that's for sure.",
				"Wow! What can I say, this recipe is absolutely spot on! I\u2019ve been wanting to try a Wellington for a while but always been a bit intimidated by the prospect, but this is a perfect step by step guide - everything worked exactly as described, and the photos of how to braid the pastry were so helpful!  Even the fussy non-vegan at my dinner party went back for seconds, and I\u2019ll definitely be doing it again for Christmas. Many thanks!!",
				"Hi! Love this recipe! Just wondering if tou need the nutritional yeast or is it just for  added nutrition?Thanks!",
				"So do delicious!!! I didn't do the sauce and had only half of the mushrooms and still it was incredibly tasty. It looks like it is complex but it's easy to follow the steps and with ingredients so easy to get... You made it easy to impress people with a fancy and delish dish without too much work \ud83d\ude09",
				"I made this beet Wellington for my Easter dinner and the non meat eaters and it was such a hit! It was actually the meat eaters favorite dish too!! Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Absolutely delicious!  Most recipes that require some more work are prone for errors, but this one turned out right the first time I made it.As I didn't have enough mushrooms, I ended up mixing half of the vegetables from the gravy with the duxelles, after mincing them in the food processor.The result was amazing, it maybe even added some more taste to the duxelles. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!",
				"Hi Ania, I have yet to make anything from your site that hasn't been incredibly tasty and rich and thought out! I made this for Christmas just past, and oh my goodness. It was D E L I C I O U S. This was my first Christmas after committing fully to veganism, and I wanted to make a dish that meant I didn't feel like I was missing out at Christmas dinner. Boy oh boy was I glad I chose this. I did as you suggested and made the gravy the day before, resulting in such a full flavour! And the leftovers... I was eating Wellington for days - and it just kept getting better! Hehe thank you for your tasty skills and for sharing all of them with us :) Erin",
				"This recipe is amazing! I made it for our main Christmas dinner and it went down an absolute treat. My dad for one isn't vegan (though he doesn happily eat the veggie and vegan meals I make a few times a week) and he even said it was \"superb\"! Thank you for sharing this fantastic meal :)",
				"I wish I could post a photo- this came out exactly like the photos on the website- and it was just delicious! My husband  was over the moon about it! Thank you!",
				"My husband and I have been following a vegetarian eating plan for almost two years now and I wanted to find something special to make for our New Year's Day dinner when I found this recipe. I spent the afternoon making the components and look forward to assembling it tomorrow - I think it is going to be amazing! Thank you!",
				"THANK YOU ANIA!!!I made this for Christmas dinner (instead of our usual seitan wellington.)It was DELICIOUS!!!!Savory and beautiful.Instead of smoked tofu, I opted for extra firm tofu and liquid smoke. We loved the subtle smoky beet flavor.It was a hit!I will definitely make this again!",
				"Really good flavour and looks lovely. It was a hit with the non-vegans this Christmas too! I didn't try the gravy as I already had some pre-made but followed the rest to the letter and it worked beautifully. Thank you!",
				"We  made this for Christmas dinner today and it was absolutely lovely; visually beautiful ,delicious and nutritious\u2014 the holy trinity.  Your instructions were perfect and the beautiful photos were an enormous help.  Thanks for yet another wonderful recipe.  Hope you and those you love have a  healthy and beautiful new year.",
				"This was my second making this dish. First time, I hadn\u2019t bought enough mushrooms so used spinach instead. It was great both times (though I prefer the mushrooms). Skipped the gravy both times, and sprinkled toasted slivered almonds on top. Great leftover too!",
				"Just made this for Christmas lunch. It was way more tasty than I expected! My non-vegan husband loved it also (he gobbled down most of it). We are definitely making this again!",
				"Dear AniaWe just made this for our vegan christmas dinner and it is an absolutely amazing dish; so flavourful and delicious! We had the good fortune of discovering your blog in the last few months and every dish we tried without fail is delicious and flavoursome; your creativity and dedication shines through in all of the recipes in the blog and we look forward to tasting them all some time! Thanks so much for making such delicious dishes accessible to us all, and keep up the amazing work!Anand",
				"incredible and even more tasty than what I could imagine!!",
				"Dear Anja. This Wellington recipe is the best! I have been making it for 3 years in a row for Christmas and I am always looking forward to it for weeks. It is just so unbelievably delicious. Usually I make a ridiculous amount of food on the 24th and then eat leftovers for the next two days in my pyjamas :D; this year I made two batches of your amazing Wellington so now I'm set for the next few days. Thank you so much for this beautiful festive recipe. It has become part of my Christmas tradition.",
				"I was wondering if there was any substitute for mushrooms? I\u2019mIntolerant and it\u2019s so hard the find a recipe without mushrooms. Thank you!",
				"We live in a remote area and I've never seen smoked tofu in our grocery store. Do you think a few drops of liquid smoke could be used with plain tofu? Thanks!",
				"Hi,I am thinking to make this for my veggie housemate at Christmas but he has a nut allergy. Do you think I could replace the walnuts with chestnuts which are apparently OK?I think I will need to make ahead and freeze the components due to time and kitchen space pressures",
				"This was incredible. A proper feast!!! I\u2019m glad I made all the components the day before. I think that\u2019s a must-do for this recipe, at least with a busy family in the house. It\u2019s a bit of work, but the rewards are huge! Absolutely delicious.",
				"I really like the idea of using a pre-baked beetroot filling (rather than just whole beetroot/squash), but I would really like to avoid using tofu. Do you think there's a possible replacement? Perhaps a some sort of grain or beans that I could use instead? Thank you!",
				"Hello AnitaI am cooking for a vegan at Christmas as well as six non.vegans.  This recipe looks wonderful but can I prepare it in advance and leave it uncooked in the fridge or freezer ?",
				"Woah, what a stunner!!I've made this Wellington for Christmas (all non-vegans except me) and it was a complete hit! The beetroot flavor is not prominent at all, the flavors are very well combined and nicely finetuned.I added a tsp of plum jam to my gravy, as my grandmother does ;) Worked out nicely.This is a wonderful dish for festive and special occasions.Love it :)"

				"Hi Ania! I have only active dry yeast. Would the recipe work if I let it activate as usually and then mix it with the dry ingredients?Thanks!",
				"Hi, can I make this as a nut roll instead of poppyseed? If so what changes would you recommend if any? Thanks!",
				"Weird question. I make this roll quite regularly - it is AMAZING. BUT......can you freeze it?  I just went crazy and made this and some choc cookies kind if forgetting that my hungry  (and skinny) daughter isn't here anymore!  I really shouldn't be eating sweet treats at all  and as it's just me and husband at home......well, we are now over-supplied with goodies! What do you think?  :)",
				"Tastes so similar to how my Oma used to make! Delicious recipe :)",
				"Incredible! I ground the poppy seeds in my high speed blender and then added the almond milk and blended a bit more before allowing it to sit. It worked out very well.",
				"Yum! I didn't have baking paper so mine wasn't as pretty as the photos, but that didn't effect the great taste! I also didn't have coconut cream so I used almond butter so I still had a fatty ingredient, and it seemed to work just fine! So my point is, the recipe is wonderful even if you have to change a few minor things.  I look forward to making it again. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd70",
				"Hi, I am hoping to try this recipe this week. I was wondering if any oil can be used for the dough in place of coconut oil?",
				"Going to make this for Christmas this year! Do you think it would work with whole wheat flour, buckwheat flour, or oat flour?Also, is instant yeast the same as fast action yeast (found in sachets)?Thanks.",
				"Bit of a delayed update, but I did end up making it and from what I can remember I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour and it turned out fine! I think I rolled the dough a bit too thin so it cracked and splodged out a bit in the oven, but it turned out better than I expected and it was delicious. I did use \"fast action yeast\" that come in sachets. I think it's the same as what you were referring to, it just seems to have different names depending on who you ask.Just so I don't mess up - because I've forgotten what I used last year - is coconut cream the solid stuff from a can of coconut milk?Thanks for the awesome recipe.",
				"Hi Ania,Could this be baked in a loaf pan instead of using the parchment paper?  Is the paper used to keep it in the log shape, or to keep it from browning too early?Thanks,Michelle",
				"I also find it unclear what exactly needs to be done with the parchment paper. How do you wrap it exactly? Do the ends need to be covered, too? Is it wrapped tightly apart from the very top of the log?",
				"Thanks for this recipe!I have Hungarian and Serbian roots, and I was introduced to all sort of savoury dishes when I was a kid. However, for some reasons sweets weren't passed on. But I did discover poppy-based pastries on trips to Hungary and Czechia and my mind was blown! Thanks for allowing me to recreate this one. I tweaked the filling a bit and used olive oil instead of coconut for the dough and it all came pretty nicely; it's been dubbed \"the most Austrian sweet that they've had in a long time\" by an expatriate Austrian ;)The quantity of dough seemed a bit off compared to the filling, I followed the recipe instead of my instinct but I couldn't put everything inside (had to eat the remaining filling straight from the bowl, he he) and it was nowhere near 3-mm thick. I'll probably double it next time (and use it for other purposes, it's a really nice dough!).",
				"My parents are Croatian, and my mother used to make poppy seed roll at Christmas.  She hasn't made this for so many years, and I miss these types of desserts around the holidays.  I'm so happy to find this recipe and can't wait to try it!  I am going to try using dates to sweeten the filling instead of sugar.  I think the texture and sweetness of dates would complement poppy seeds really well.   Also, I just looked up poppy seeds on cronometer, and they are very high in calcium, so that's and extra bonus!",
				"EXCELLENT RECIPE! I have made this twice. I have been missing poppyseed roll so much and now I can have it again. Thank you!",
				"Absolutely delicious! I did swap the candied orange for fresh lemon zest, and it still worked a treat.",
				"I do love the poppy seed roll  / cake and was able to buy it at the Preston Market from a stall that sold coffee and other Italian biscuits, cakes etc. The stall bought these rolls in from another pastry cook, who retired at the age of 80, so hence you cannot buy them anymore. I do love the walnut version, my Slovenian mother in law made them at Christmas and I wish I could have been with her when she made them, so I could make them myself, Is there any chance that you could do a vegan version of the walnut roll?",
				"I'm super excited to make this! I'm just confused about the baking in paper part. Do you put the roll into some sort of pan after you roll it in the baking paper?",
				"My partners mother and stepmother (both Slovenian) made a version of this using walnuts, any chance that you could do a recipe for this too?",
				"I bought a new packet of  the yeast you specified so I really don\u2019t know what happened! \ud83d\ude29",
				"Made this for Christmas. The filling was amazing but my dough didn\u2019t rise. But it still tasted wonderful..Any suggestions for making the dough rise. I live in a hot country so there is no problem with getting enough warmth for the dough to rise.?",
				"Hello!  Have you ever tried using a high powered blender such as Vitamix for the poppy seed grinding?  I wondered if the quantity was too small - or maybe soften in the plant milk then blend? Thanks",
				"This thing is seriously SOO delicious. Was one of the tougher things I\u2019ve ever baked (never done the kneading process before) but nevertheless my husband and I can\u2019t get enough it. Going to keep making it over and over. Thank you for this recipe!",
				"Do you think spelt flour would work?",
				"I also make this traditional Hungarian delicacy without the icing on Roland a walnut filled roll too. I am lucky to have a poppyseed grinder but there is ground poppyseeds in my local  Hungarian shop called  Paprika in Beeston Nottingham. There are branches in London Scotland and Ireland.",

Thanks for that hint.Sarah",

				"Ok, I'll remedy that for you then... I like mine with a sprinkling of sugar and LOTS of applesauce, 'cause that's how I grew up eating them (of course, they weren't latkes, but their German cousins, Kartoffelpuffer). That is how you will typically find them at fests, too, although recently, they've started to be available with sour cream, too (if I remember correctly). Considering that applesauce was the only thing they did NOT offer at the Chicago Christmas Market, I'd say that was a serious faux-pas!",

				"Just made these and they are gorgeous!  I used maple syrup, but added a tablespoon of flax meal and only one tablespoon of aquafaba.  Mine were perfect after 15 minutes in the oven.  They look just like your picture and have a lovely, fudgy texture with deep chocolate flavor.  I used raw hazelnuts, which were fine.   Also, when I ground the nuts in the first step, I made the additional cup of hazelnut meal as well.  I think chocolate chips in the dough would not be amiss ;)  Tagging you on instagram!",
				"Do you use raw or roasted hazelnuts?",
				"i am not vegan - can i use an egg instead of the aquafaba?",
				"I will try out this recipe this week. It looks wonderful!! I also adore this flavour combination!My family is the same with the crazy  amount of work we take on at the holidays. Well, specifically my Mom used to and then me. Just in the last 2 years I\u2019ve said No. It\u2019s my holiday too and I want the opportunity to relax a little and enjoy it. You just have to let yourself off the hook of being responsible for everything. Such a relief."

				"I haven't had pecan pie in 35 years and decided to try this. It is by far the best pecan pie I've ever eaten.",
				"I absolutely love this fantastic pecan pie! A friend of mine who lives vegan recommended it to me a few years ago. I've made the pie three times now and the second time, I used some cheaper vanilla extract and thought I could save a few bucks. Oh boy, was I wrong! It almost ruined the flavour of this delicious aromatic pie and cost me the \"oh wow, can't believe that's vegan\" experience at the family dinner table. Never doing that again!I've found that although I halved the maple syrup on my second and third attempt, the pie is still on the verge of being too sweet (yes, even for a pie). I'll try also halving the brown sugar next time and hopefully will achieve a result that better fits my German taste buds.All the best - Tanja",
				"I quit eggs few years ago, although not vegan, being a vegetarian and egg free pretty much eliminates conventional desserts for me. I tried this pecan pie and it was unbelievable!  Not only vegan but you cannot tell the difference. It\u2019s easy, rich in flavor and really awesome texture. Everyone who ate just could not believe how amazing it was being vegan!",

Absolutely divino !  The grated orange peel comes through subtly and every bite is quite heavenly packed with nuts and flavour. Effort required for the dough making well worth it !

I had never had pecan pie before, combined with the fact I was making it vegan, I wasn\u2019t sure how this would turn out but everyone absolutely loved the flavours and it was a huge success with my American flatmate spending her first Thanksgiving in London. Will definitely become a regular on the dessert list!",

I have been too nervous to make them since our change of diet, not sure why. But I may give it a go.... tricky bit will be estimating the bake time I reckon...",
				"Hi, can this pie be made the day ahead? If so I think it needs to go in the fridge what do you think? If you really think I shouldn\u2019t make it a day ahead,  I won\u2019t because it\u2019s for Thanksgiving and I wanted to be really great. Thanks",

				"Thank you for this recipe.  We have a daughter that is 99% vegan.  She is also gluten intolerant so I am thinking about swapping out the all purpose flour with pecan meal/flour to create a gluten-free option.  I have had good luck with that in the past.",

I used fresh cranberries, kept them at one end of the baking sheet and was glad I did -- easier to remove from oven in advance of the beans. They were just becoming carmelized and sticky, which we loved! A Thanksgiving hit even for our true-blue carnivores.",

Lol) I'll probably sub with paprika or cumin. Also, wouldn't frozen cranberries work? I doubt you'd even need to thaw them first. Thanks!"

E.g. to hold it all together, etc.? Thank you in advance :)",
				"Hi Ania, I've been cooking from your recipes for quite some time now and thought I'd finally leave a reply. I absolutely adore this bread! The flavour reminds me of Dutch Kruidnoten, which I haven't had in a long time, so I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing pumpkin bread. The consistency is just perfect (I used buckwheat flour), it's all very well balanced. Will definitely be making this more often! It also freezes very well, which is a plus as I would otherwise eat it all in a day or two..Just a wee question, do you reckon I could use pumpkin seeds in stead of pecan nuts, or is there something else nut free that you could recommend?  I'll be making this for friends, hopefully soon, but it has to be nut free. Thank you so much for all your amazing recipes!",
				"Just made it yesterday and this recipe is definitely a keeper! It looks great even without the frosting, it's moist and easy to make (I roasted my pumpkin). Had only cane sugar so subbed the original suggestion for that (much less sugar went in as cane sugar is sweeter). Thank you Anita for sharing another great recipe!",

I had a bit of umami spice ( from Trader Joe\u2019s grocer  in America ) so I added that into a cup of vegetable stock to make up for the mushroom water. I added a bay leave as well. I think next time I might throw the mushrooms in a food processor with a bit of firm tofu to create more of a crumble consistency to stick to the pasta a bit more. I chopped the onions small but I think i would make them even smaller next time and add more lentils. This was such a delicious dish I can\u2019t wait to play more with it.",
				"We enjoyed this bolognese last night and I forgot to take a picture, but it was delicious. I did saute some tomato paste after the vegetables prior to adding any liquid as that's how I used to make a meat based version. I use my food processor to chop all the vegetables, mushrooms after the others to speed things up a little. I must remember to add fennel as one reviewer suggested.  I've been a vegan 15 months and I've made several versions of this and this is my favorite. I don't even care for mushrooms, but they make this dish what it is and now I always keep dried ones on hand. Wish I could find chestnut mushrooms, but just used baby portabellas for the fresh ones. Thanks for a great recipe with easy to follow instructions for when you're in a hurry!",

It did take a while to prep everything, but I expected that. I served it over fettuccini for dinner, and even my meat-loving husband said it was fantastic. I just had some leftovers over rice, which worked quite nicely. The only tweak I made was to add a splash of sou sauce toward the end of cooking (I had also intended to add a couple of Tbs of tomato paste before adding the liquids, but I forgot). This recipe really is a keeper, and is delicious and satisfying in its own right (not just as a stand-in for what's usually a meat recipe). Well done - I look forward to trying more of you recipes :-)",

It might be a dumb question, but can this be made without mushrooms?

				"Wonderful! I added seiten as well. The recipe is definitely for keeps . I also decided to steam the veges prior to adding them to the pot, each per their own time to get them al dente. Amazing, no mushy vegetables in the dish at all! Thumbs up from Israel! Thanks \u2665\ufe0f",

				"This meal was everything i needed. It was so yummy, warming and easy to make. I am looking forward to trying more recipes, thank you sharing you gift and skills with the world.",
				"New favourite! This is so good, and so versatile. We make a large pot of broth then steam whatever veggies we have on hand and throw in some brown rice or rice noodles... delicious every time.",
				"Dear Ania,You have become my number one vegan blog, and every week I cannot wait to see what you come up with next. I am still working my way through all your past recipes, so have this one ear-marked for tonight. I am a bit aubergine-mad at the moment, so what do you think - cut in chunks and pre-fry the aubergine in a bit of oil before hand or  simply add with the sweet potato?  By the way, I have made your sticky chinese aubergine last week (https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-chinese-aubergine/) and it was a winner!Thanks so much for sharing our recipes with us - you are a gem.",
				"Hi Ania Made this today it was super delicious! And so easy. Best red thai curry i have had and I made it! Will definitely be one of my fav meals to make now. thanks Kay -",
				"I will file this in my 'Favorite Recipes' folder!  It was easy, quick and the flavors were comforting.  I did make oneboo-boo though - I added the red curry paste after the coconut milk instead of cooking it with the aromatics.  Nexttime I'll do it right, who knows, it might blow my socks off.  Thanks, Aniap.s. didn't have fresh lemongrass so I added 4 drops of lemongrass essential oil.  In case you're not a huge fan of lemongrass,I suggest you add it one drop at a time.",
				"Hi Ania, 2 questions:1. Do you have a recipe for a red curry paste? There aren\u2019t many brands here, and I didn\u2019t love the ones I\u2019ve tried2. Can I use baby corn from a can or is it better to just not use it at all? I don\u2019t even know how fresh baby corn looks like ;) Thank you!",
				"Oh my gosh - this was super delicious.  I had beans and brocollini on hand but no cauli or baby corn but it was still bowl licking good.  I took your suggestion of steaming the greens separately and then adding to the sauce - beautiful and vibrant.  This recipe is even been than our local Thai restaurant!  Thanks for a great recipe.",
				"why are there red chillies in the photo and not in the recipe?",
				"This is a keeper! Will try it next week. :-)"

				"Delicious!",
				"Can I use dried kaffir lime leaves? There aren\u2019t any Asian markets close to me and it seems like Amazon sells them fresh but it would take a couple weeks to get to me. I can buy dried ones to be delivered right away though.",

				"Hi Ania, Is this brown rice flour?",
				"Hi, I\u2019d just like to correct you on the lime leaves. They\u2019re called kefir like the yogurt not kaffir, which mean non muslim or gentile. Hope that helps coz i personally live in Indonesia where we use lots of those leaves & fruit rinds for flavoring.",

				"very good! I loved it so much! its just a bit tricky with the wrappers but it ended up getting easier and was so much fun to make!tysm for this recipe <3",
				"very good yes",
				"I don't know where I went wrong with this one. Everything seemed fine until it came to filling and wrapping up the dumplings - I couldn't put a lot of filling in per dumpling and none of them wanted to close up for me (even after googling a different method - the fold and pinch sealing one). :( Maybe because I used all purpose flour instead of bao? I also don't have a wok so I used a frying pan? Also maybe the dough was left a bit too long proofing because the filling section took a while to prepare and make. They still tasted lovely, just every one of them opened in the steamer. Sorry for the wall of text!",
				"So can u use a vegetable steamer? I have one with the basket but don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for this recipe.",
				"Just made these... leaving some notes for future cooks. Followed recipe to a tee, but couldn't fit all buns in my steamer so went with six in the steamer and six to proof on the kitchen bench. The ones that proofed over steam were undercooked, and totally deflated. I steamed-proof for 30 minutes, properly steamed for 20, and then left to rest for another 20 minutes. Dough was raw. The ones I left to proof on the bench for 60 minutes I then steamed for 25, and then left them to rest for a good 40 or so minutes were absolutely perfect. I am not sure what went wrong with the first lot but it is an amazing recipe, so much flavour etc., just next time i will do the standard bench proof.",

They're so so incredible \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0dI want to make a bigger batch to deliver some to my parents' house for them to enjoy too, should I double the recipe or make it twice\u00bf Thanks you so muchh Ania",

				"Thank you so much for your recipe! Just a question, where did you get your amazing steamer baskets from?",
				"Hey Ania, I love all you recipes! Can I ask what size your steamer is? I\u2019m just going to buy one and can\u2019t work out what size to go for! Thanks, Rosie x",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! I just tried it and they turned out great. I'm not vegan but try to eat less meat. The these taste so yummy :)",
				"If I have a smaller steamer set up and wanted to work in batches, what would be my best course of action? Form as many as fit, let them proof in the steamer, steam them, and then move on to the next batch? Form them all and then proof and steam as ready?So excited to make these tonight!",
				"thanks a lot for your suggestion Ania . I wanted to propose this course in my veggie restaurant  called Annadata in the west sea coast in France. :-) warm regards Myriam",
				"hi Ania,  could you tell me what kind of sauce you can serve with the buns  . thank you for your quick replyMyriam",

				"Thank you AnitaLooking  forward to trying them out soon \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Thank you for this lovely recipe. On your website you have the best thrilling vegan recipes.",
				"Anla, this looks like a great recipe. It says at the beginning that the buns can be made a day ahead.  Is that just the dough or the filled bun? Would the dough not continue rising in the fridge overnight?",
				"I dont have any ginger and want to avoid going out to the store, do you think it'll still work out without that?",
				"I can't get shaoxing wine or any alcoholic substitutes, can I omit it from the recipe?",

				"I made this cake yesterday and it was moist, delicious, and sophisticated! An excellent cake that will be revisited in the future.  Very rich, too!I hate it when people change a recipe and then review it, but sometimes changes are necessary. Thankfully, it is a very flexible recipe: I substituted almonds and almond flour (as hazelnuts can be hard to find where I live in the US). Used almond extract, instead of vanilla.   Most importantly, I ended up having to use Okara that we have from making soy milk.   (My local store no longer carries silken tofu). I really wasn't sure whether the Okara would work, but was fine.  The cake had some wobble when I removed it from the oven, but I followed the instructions to let it cool before cutting. It then set up properly.Lastly, whipping up the Aquafaba was a new and cool experience. Appreciate the advice to tip the bowl over as a way to check that it was beaten enough.",
				"Oopsie I whipped in my chocolate because it didn't say fold til the next step  :) it's looking pretty flat can I save it or just hope for the best?",

				"This cake is incredible! I just made it and it turned out so well. Mine hasn't even cooled completely yet but I just had to taste it. It's chocolatey and moist but at the same time fluffy and light. I'm definitely making this for my birthday. If you love chocolate cake you need to try this one. I've tried quite a few chocolate cake recipes but this one stands out. I don't usually comment on recipes but I can so recommend making this cake.Thanks you Ania for sharing this recipe!",
				"Hi Ania,I had bookmarked this recipe months ago and I was saving it for a special occasion. Today was my dad's birthday and since he loves chocolate and hazelnuts I made it for him!I followed yout recipe exactly (the non gluten-free version) and it turned out incredible. But the most pleasant surprise, for me, was how much fun I had making it. The aquafaba meringue, the bain- marie, the folding...since becoming vegan this was one recipe that made me feel like a french cruelty-free pastry chef :)Thank you for your generous recipes, you do not omit any tip or step, it shows that you really want us to succeed.Have a nice Sunday,Baci Silvia",
				"Thanks so much for the recipe. I made it yesterday and it is very rich and quite yummy. Sort of tangy from all the dark chocolate, and a melt in the mouth, soft texture. It definitely needs the hazelnuts on top for the hazelnut taste as much as decoration.The aquafaba increases significantly in volume when whipped, so make sure to use a large bowl. I cooked mine a few minutes longer than stated as it was still wobbly in the middle after half an hour. I wasn't sure if the temperature was 180 degrees for  fan or conventional, so assumed conventional and dropped the temperature  to 170 for my fan oven. I used a 20cm square tin and it turned out fine. Expensive to make, but worth it for a treat. A small serve is enough so it goes a long way."

Step 8 took a bit longer than anticipated and I only used 1 can of butter beans as that's what I had in the cupboard and to be honest, for us, it was enough beans, but other than that, this recipe was spot on.

				"Hello there, tried your recipe for the first time and they looked yummy! Only thing I would say is to blind bake pastry first as at least my vegan puff pastry (coconut) did not get golden in those 15 minutes required for baking the tarts. Also, the filling wasn't enough for 12 tarts, so next time I will double it. Had to use caster sugar on top of them in stead of icing sugar as icing sugar got absorbed by the moisture of tarts before I could use the blowtorch. Great recipe though, will definitely try again! Tasty! Thank you",

It was so nice too, to taste test the raw mixture and not get salmonella  :)  I think I'll even add some more lemon to the mix  and try it on a biscuit crumb for a baked cheesecake ?Great website, can't wait to try some more of your creations .",

				"Hi. I have just made the custard! Yum. I ended up using extra tofu as I didn\u2019t want to waste the leftover tofu. It has made a beautiful custard. I blended in my Magimix blender but wasn\u2019t satisfied so finished it off in the NutriBullet which has made it silken smooth.I actually wanted to make a trifle with the custard! I\u2019ve made too much custard as I doubled the recipe. Oops. So do you think the custard would freeze okay? I\u2019m a learner so hopefully that isn\u2019t a stupid question!Wonderful recipe. Very sweet and creamy. Thank you.",

				"Also, you generally cant buy maple syrup in my country, so I was considering to replace it with sugar syrup (light or dark?), but I have never tasted maple syrup and dont know how this will affect the taste? Or texture? Nuts are also insanely expensive here, so if anyone have tried replacing the cashews with something else, I happily hear about how that went! :) Thanks! :)",

From the photo of it being cut, it looks very firm almost jelly-like? Do you have any tips on how to make it more creamy, and less firm? And I read a comment saying she had cut down on the maple syrup and it still tasted great, so I was thinking about doing the same since it might otherwise be too sweet for what I have in mind, but do you have any guess to how this might affect the texture?Thank you! :)",

I must buy saffron to see if I can get the colour more like yours in the photo - for now I use tumeric but I find the colour is not quite what I am looking for.",

First, you nearly perfectly retain the non- vegan textures. Second, you also perfect the familiar colours. These 2 things alone make vegan baking a real possibility instead of a slowly developing lofty goal. Thank you. Finally, I am confident in my ability to assess flavour based on the recipe alone. These look wonderful. I will be sure to post images as soon as I give this a try. Moussaka looks great too. Thank you.",

Yours is without a doubt the best vegan food blog on the internet (maybe even overall, including non-vegan blogs), in that while there are other places around with good recipes I don't know of anywhere else that combines the genius you have for balancing flavours with culinary inventiveness and flair, while somehow managing to do so twice a week across a variety of styles of world cuisine. It's genuinely beyond my comprehension.The majority of our household's weekly meals now tend to be sourced from the recipes you've so generously shared. Thanks for making our vegan shift that much more enjoyable.",
				"Hi Ania; Very excited to try this vegan parmesan and was just ready to print out the recipe when I realized you hadn't included the black olives in the recipe. I happen to have some sliced Greek kalamata's on hand so want to incorporate those. The few times I've used olives in a pasta dish I've tossed them in after the pasta is added to the sauce, but I wonder if you have given them a quick saute with the chili flakes and garlic?"

I was just looking up the herbs I needed to pick up again (I don't make it during winter so I forgot) when I saw that reply and even though I never leave a comment, I felt like I had to. This recipe is so good I can only get 3 portions out of it and I eat the whole thing by myself. I have to admit I'm too lazy to mash the tofu with a fork so I tend to put all the ingredients in my magimix and get the filling that way, and it is delicious.Thank you for bringing spanakopita into my life, I'm pretty sure it will always be a favorite!",
				"This is the best vegan spanakopita recipe that I have found! I have made other recipes that I thought were pretty good but my kids were not as enthused to thwe point where I stopped bothering altogether because it is unmotivating to make a dinner that does not cause your family joy. Then recently I decided to try again because I was really in the mood for spanakopita and I found this recipe. The flavour was perfection and the lovely spiral structure made for very satisfying texture for every bite. EVERYONE HAD THIRDS!!!  I did not make a great effort to squeeze the water out of the spinach and it was still perfect. Excited to make it again tonight !",

				"This is absolutely beautiful  and looks delicious. I am wondering, though, would it be worth trying to make this without the tofu or is it totally necessary for the filling to be spanakopita-y?  Asking as a vegan who can't eat soy but desperately misses spanakopita :)",
				"What the Greeks call Spanakopita we the Macedonians call Zelnik (Zel - neek) and we have many different variations of ours. Ania you have done it again and have veganised my most favourite lunch, dinner and snack recipe from my childhood. My Baba (grandmother) would assemble all of her sisters, daughters, nieces, and granddaughters once a month at 5 a.m. to start making the phyllo pastry from scratch. I had the most important job she would always tell me because I had the melted butter that had to be sprinkled around on ever single layer before she would fold it all back together and stretch it again and again. It was the most buttery, delicate pastry she ever made. There were many different kinds of Zelnik pies made and about 4 or 5 per household for coming together. This was a family get together and at the end of the day the kitchen was filled with Zelnik goodness and a few pans of Baklava for our dessert, besides we have the phyllo pastry already made so why not? I still do this but seeing as I'm one person I have resorted to the vegan phyllo pastry from the store. Thank you for doing this dish for the people of the Baltic region. <3"

I\u2019ve taken it at night and during the day so works both times. I work in a hospital and DO NOT have the flu injections each year . I use this remedy and have great faith in it. May this be of benefit to you.",

Pretty healthy as little oil.Hope you are both well enough to enjoy your Welsh weekend."

The pastry is a bit fiddly, but hey that's pastry for you, just remember to keep everything cool, all of the time and it'll be fine. The textures and the flavours and everything makes for a perfect bite every time. Thank you",
				"This recipe is simply perfect! Before I was vegan I used to work in a French bakery and we had a veeery similar tart there. This recipe made me so proud that I could make something like that myself (although I did cheat a little bit and used store bought pastry because it was quicker).",
				"I made this yesterday, following the recipe without changes, and it was quite nice. I had trouble with a couple of things, one was knowing how much water to add to the tart crust, it would help if there was something more descriptive about what it would look or act like when it's been sufficiently hydrated. My crust ended up a little tough so I suspect I added too much water? I'm not sure, but I didn't feel super confident about that step and next time I'll just use store bought crust.The filling tasted amazing both before and after baking. It still wasn't browning after 55 minutes in the oven and the crust was starting to get overdone so I wound up taking it out at that point in time. I'm not sure what happened there, but despite the lack of browning/crispiness on top we thought it tasted really good after cooling and slicing it, just had to eat around the crust a little bit. It was very tender and moist but held its shape enough to slice, which was nice. Anyway, thanks for the recipe!",

This will become a staple along with so many of your other recipes.",

Thanks so much for such a lovely, easy recipe!",
				"Perfect recipe! I've made this twice, it is absolutely delicious! I have not had results as  pretty as Ania, but likely because I used frozen raspberries instead of fresh. Though it still looked presentable, and tasted delicious!",
				"As a Canadian I'd never actually tried Bakewell tart but I'd always wanted to try making it. I know I love the combination of almond and raspberry so it seemed like a winner to me.The only problem I found with this recipe was that the batter was too dry - not even wet enough to be packed together. I added a few tablespoons of water to get a thick batter, and the tart still came out absolutely deliciously. I would definitely make this recipe again - a real winner!",

And the almond cream with the raspberries was divine!!! The Combination of all ingredients and the sweetness was perfect! We all loved it!! Thank you so much for sharing your amazing recipes with us! You are so talented! Much love to you guys!",

				"Hi Ania, I'm not a huge fan of buckwheat, can I just use gluten free all purpose flour for the pastry? ThanksJenni",
				"How do you store it if made a day ahead?",
				"Had  great succcess with this recipe. I followed the regular gluten recipe but used vegan butter instead of coconut oil. Found the tart needed an additional maybe 10-15 minutes  in the oven. Delicious and complimented by all the non vegans at the gathering . Thank you for your recipe!!!",
				"Hi Ania,I'm making this on the weekend, do you think it's better to make it and serve cooled on the day or would it be ok to make it the day before?Thanks!GG",
				"Wonderful recipe!  My new coworkers ate it all up in a single morning. Thank you x",

			"comments": [
				"Well It's lucky I live in a house without a partner, because sticking fingers in bowls then licking them is very unattractive! This is such an awesome recipe (I did not make the salad as was just making the fetta recipe alone). I used 3 tbsp of lemon juice and 2 tbsp of macadamia milk with 1 tbsp of olive oil. No idea if that was a good combo for the wet ingredients but it seems to be, for sure. I also split the quantity to keep some in the soft state (you had me at 'spread on a bagel') and topped on toast and fresh tomato. I recommend this as it's really fresh and goes great with tomato. Some basil would have made it even better! The lemon juice really makes it I think. I also had no cheesecloth or even a tea towel so cut up an old gingham dress to use (don't worry...it was really not at all age appropriate). The other half is in the fridge now. Cheers Ania for this. I will make the bocconcini next.",
				"Does it need to be almond milk? I am shielding and can only get food delivered once per week but I have LOTS of oat milk!",

				"This sounds amazing and I will try it.  I have been trying to eat plant-based since January and being a cheeseaholic, it\u2019s a struggle.  I also love Greek food and especially feta. I prefer the creamy texture rather than firm/dry.  I will definitely try this although I recently found a good brand of plant-based Feta that has the taste and texture I love.  I will try this recipe though and I\u2019m glad someone else asked about using red miso paste because that was all I could find in my small city. Thanks for all your wonderful recipes.",

				"That feta looks wonderful! Thanks for sharing :)",
				"waouw,  so far I just made the feta, but I guess next time I will make more. I just did not know what  are silvered almonds, and you do not have the recipe in polish, so I just followed your instructions, but I took the peels off after soaking. Unfortunately my blender refused to cooperate, even after grinding the almonds in my  good old Moulinette (must be between 40 and 50 years old) but then Moulinette finished the job quite well.  I can't wait to eat. Thanks a lot, merci beaucoup, dzienkuje bardzo!"

I was using already peeled bananas from the freezer and so threw caution to the wind and went from 200g peeled bananas. I checked after 22 minutes and ended up leaving them another 10 for a total of 32 minutes bake time and that was perfect. I will be making these again though perhaps trying a wee bit less banana next time",
				"I followed the recipe to the exact but the middle of the muffins were doughy and uncooked....even cooking longer, they never cooked properly.",
				"Was really excited to make banana bread muffins so I tried this recipe but as others have said there is no where near enough flour in the recipe!! I cooked for almost 30 mins but I had a feeling that 60 grams flour with so many wet ingredients wouldn't work out, should of gone with my instincts.... I would say this needs double the amount flour.",
				"Oh my god, these turned out sooooo freaking delicious! I want to eat the whole tray. I made these in a mini muffin tray in my toaster oven, and followed the recipe exactly (though I omitted the slivered almond topping). My baby girl is going to love these muffins when she wakes up :-) Thank you for sharing a SUPER TASTY recipe for the best banana bread muffins EVERRR!",
				"I\u2019ve made these at least 4 times and they turn out perfect! It\u2019s my go to recipe for when i have over ripe bananas. They\u2019ve turned out great with both buckwheat and whole wheat flour.  I make them for my kids and add a little chocolate chips. They love them and they\u2019re always gone by the next day \ud83e\udd23",
				"What do you think that calories are per muffin??They were delicious! I loved them!",
				"These are amazing! I made them today, I increased the ingredients to get 9 muffins, as I had some friends visiting. Really simple, quick to make, I like the short ingredients list. My son, 3.5 year old had two already (2nd one he took/stole from the tray without asking!)  Will definitely add to my favourite list, thanks for the recipe.",
				"Will this work with plain white flour?",
				"Having recently started a plant based diet, this recipe is far yummier than my non-vegan banana bread which I no longer miss! I added dark chocolate chips in it and it\u2019s amaaaaazing. The kids fight over them every single time. My oven is quite hot so I turn the temp down slightly and cook them a few mins longer than suggested. I hardly write comments on recipes but this was too good and so easy to make :)",
				"Love these! Made it with whole rice flour and it turn out fantastic. Also added crumble on top, also made with wrf. Thanks for yet another great recipe!",
				"Hi Ania Thank you for such an easy recipe! I used sunflower butter and muffins came out fluffy and moist. My only concern is I could taste baking soda  or baking powder a little bit as the muffins had a slight metallic taste to them.  If I use less of baking soda and baking powder would  the muffins still rise? Otherwise it is the most moist vegan, gluten-free muffins I\u2019ve ever made so far! \ud83d\ude00",
				"Hello AniaI loved this recipe, thank you!I was just wondering, do you think they could be frozen?Moe",
				"While I did adapt this a little bit, these muffins were so delicious and moist! Perfect mini muffins for our toddler. I used 1/2 amount of maple syrup because my bananas were super ripe and previously frozen aka extra liquid-y. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt and used white whole wheat flour. Little additions that made them extra yummy. Thank you!",
				"These have become my go-to muffin recipe! I love how healthy they are and my 2 year old gobbles them up! I always make a double batch, but that doesnt mean they last as long as they probably should (:",
				"I made these but I have to \"tweak\" the recipe a bit, I didn't have any maple syrup so I did use the coconut sugar and found when I added the flour (Buckwheat) it was a little dry so I added some apple sauce and maple essence, as well as some cinnamon - delicious",
				"Hi, these turned out pretty well for a first try. I used  50g buckwheat flour and  10g flaxseed and coconut sugar. I have  a fan oven so baked at 16 0 degrees but had to bake for about 25 mins.  I think these will taste even better tomorrow when the flavours have had a chance to develop. They would be delicious warmed up for breakfast! \ud83d\ude0b",

For my second attempt, I doubled the flour (I used Bobs all purpose GF flour) and baked them at 375 for 16 minutes. They turned out perfect!! This will definitely be my go-to muffin recipe!",
				"This is a fantastic recipe! I used all purpose flour, crunchy natural peanut butter and added some mini choc chips.I made 12 small cupcakes instead of muffins and the result was a light, delicious treat that will be perfect with a cup of tea for an afternoon treat. I will be making this recipe over and over again, thank you so much for sharing!",

I used buckwheat flour but I don't always have it on hand, so I was wondering if oat flour would work instead. Any thoughts?xx",

				"These turned out wonderfully! Lovely and soft, with a slight fudgy quality that is delicious. I swapped the maple syrup for golden syrup and it worked great.",
				"Thank you soooo much for this very easy recipe! I've been baking bread and muffins for years and this is so far the quickest and easiest recipe I've ever found! I baked it on bread tin and sliced it before serving to my kiddos (5 and 2yrs old) and they absolutely love this! I use whatever available in my cupboard that includes macademia butter or pumpkin butter, date syrup, cassava flour or buckwheat flour thrown some flaxseed, chia and hemp seeds as well and all comes out nice and fluffy.",
				"You are a genius! These are by far the best muffins I\u2019ve made, so light and fluffy.   Way better than those I used to make with dairy and white flour. The only additions I made were to add vegan chocolate chips and flaxseed meal. I used whole-wheat flour.",
				"Do you think soft brown sugar would work as a sweetener?",
				"Hi, These muffins turned out quite uncooked inside ( I used all-purpose wheat flour).  What's I have done wrong?  Thanks!",
				"Hey there, any chance you could leave out the sugar/maple syrup all together? I know they wouldn't be as sweet but do you think they would still bake OK or is it all a delicate chemistry balance?",
				"I made these today.  Super easy but seemed undercooked, so I cooked it a bit longer and it burnt a bit and crumble apart.  Seems to be missing something.   Still very tasty...",
				"Tried these this morning and they were so easy and delicious! I like them even better than non-vegan muffins. Thanks Ania!",

				"I'm not quite sure what I did wrong but I couldn't get my muffins to bake completely in the middle. I've gone back over the instructions & can't see anything obvious other than I used Nuttelex instead of peanut/almond butter. I used regular plain flour.  Any tips for a very novice baker?!  I increased the length of cooking time too but still no joy.",

Halved the recipe (boyfriend likes his pancakes savoury and as much as I believe I could devour ten of those delicious things myself I thought it best not to accept that challenge) and actually had to add some liquid, despite the blueberries releasing some liquid as they thawed. Might have something to do with that oat milk is thicker than almond milk? I also omitted the almond butter since I only had peanut butter at home and didn\u2019t want it to take over the flavour too much. I\u2019m really impressed with how they turned out as I usually find thicker pancakes a bit soggy in the middle, but not this time!",
				"Hi!These pancakes look amazing! Do you think it would work with frozen blueberries though? The fresh ones you buy are to me not real blueberries since they are white-ish inside instead of blue all the way through like the ones you pick yourself! Such a luxury to have them in the freezer as well to last until it\u2019s picking season again :)",

Vega\u2019s Coconut Almond flavor will be super tasty I think), would I just need to add more banana for the moisture ratio? Maybe apple sauce?

				"Hii, do you think this recipe would work with Cashews and Potatoes and a replacement to the Tofu? We made this last night, and although it was good, I think the tofu was a bit strong for us (we're new to the tofu-wagon!) but I make a delicious cheese sauce with cashews, potatoes and carrots. I wonder if that would work here too? I've never baked it though. Thanks for the recipe! We can't wait to try again!",
				"I'm catering a lunch for a friend's intimate afternoon wedding, and these tarts will be a delightful complement to the spread. Thanks for the great recipe!",
				"If you were making this a part of a buffet, could it be made the day before successfully?",
				"You wouldn't get wild garlic where I live  'down under'- recently no rain for 4 months!   Used normal garlic.    I thought it might be a bit short of texture so added some corn kernels.   My 26cm loose bottomed tart tin is fairly deep so I had to double the recipe to fill it and cook getting on for an hour..   The result was very good.",
				"Made these recently and they were amazing! A little time consuming to make (mainly cause I'm bad at prep) but so easy and delicious! I could not source the wild garlic here so used fresh garlic clove but it still turned out really well. Looking forward to making them again and experimenting with different veggie fillings! \u2665",
				"I've never heard of wild garlic.  Can you suggest any substitutions?   They look delicious.",
				"Do you have to use the pastry right away or can you refrigerate/freeze it for a few days? Which would you recommend?",
				"Hi, would it be ok to replace the chickpea flour with another type of flour? If so, what would you recommend? Can't wait to start cooking, it looks so delicious x",
				"Hello,Any idea what could work to replace tofu? I can\u2019t eat it and tarts look sooooo good :)",
				"Such a great recipe!! I made this with peas and fresh garlic because I couldn\u2019t find any wild garlic and it was really tasty. I made a large tart and ended up cooking it for 45 mins. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks \ud83d\ude00",
				"Do you think this recipe is freezer friendly ? Thanks :)",
				"These look so cute and yummy! These would be perfect for a work potluck (putting this recipe in my back pocket for later) - Thanks for sharing!",
				"For some reason I don't associate garlic, wild or otherwise, with Britain. Do you think some homesick Roman soldier, or cook, might have planted it as they  tramped through the mud and dark woods while dreaming of warmer climes? \ud83d\ude09"

				"Okay, YUM! LOVE having taco night, and this is such a simple (and SO delicious) recipe to really bring up the flavour factor and even the meat eaters at the table fell in love! (I'm always so happy to show off how delightful a veg meal can be)I'll be making this frequently! Thanks so much for this recipe! Have already passed it along to a few veg friends to try too!",
				"These Pulled Mushroom Tacos are seriously the best vegan meal I\u2019ve made. This recipe is now bookmarked and will be a staple in our home. It is full of flavor and easy to make. I\u2019m so grateful to have found this recipe and Lazy Cat Kitchen!!!",
				"Such a fantastic recipe! It's tasty and quite simple to make. Preparing the mushrooms a day ahead also makes it very convenient when you have friends over. And everyone who tried it just love it (even meat-eater guests).This is now my go to recipe for pulled mushrooms: I also use them in burgers for example.I definitely recommend.Tr",
				"These are SO GOOD  !I've made the mushroom version, but can't stomach too much mushroom due to an intolerance - though it doesn't stop me sometimes ! Just wanted to let you know I experimented with eggplant as substitute, and after a bit of tweaking it works! I salt, wash and blot thin slices (so it is a bit more time consuming) and then cut them into equally thin strips. Fried everything up the same, then baked for about 20min, turned the mixture and then another 20m to crisp it up,  it was perfect. These are literally a staple for me now, I make them at least once a fortnight, sometimes more. :PThank you for this recipe !!",
				"These were fab! thanks for sharing. I wondered were you bought your large wooden serving board from?",
				"this recipe is a total game changer for me! SO GOOD!",
				"I see a few people have used portobellos instead.... another pulled mushroom recipe I tried roasted the portobellos first, said it helps shred them. Would you recommend the same or will they shred fine raw and follow the recipe as written?? Thank you, I can't wait to try this next week!",
				"Hi Ania,Are there any alternatives to the adobo paste which I can use?  Looking forward to making them!Thank you.",
				"A while ago I had a bowl at a restaurant with amazing pulled mushroom in it - this tasted just the same! I didn't make the entire recipe, just the pulled mushroom part, but honestly, these pulled mushrooms were so delicious anything must taste awesome with them.",
				"Do I have to bake it at the end if I made it straight away?",
				"Omg I have been plantbased 3 years and this is by far the most delicious  taco recipe I have tried thus far vegan or otherwise . These MADE my 5 de Mayo festivial of 1 top notch haha and ate it alllll last night. Thank you so much for sharing. I only had 7oz of mushrooms so I added a can of jackfruit. worked amazingly well together in this recipe and I'm thinking of making it again today.",
				"Thanks so much! One more question sorry! I saw someone asking about using regular oyster mushrooms which is what I have as well. You recommend just marinating the mushrooms and putting them straight in the oven rather than sauteeing them first. What does that mean for the liquid? Since in your procedure you say to cook the mushrooms in the sauce until most of the liquid gets absorbed. Thanks!",
				"Hi! I'm really excited to try this. I followed the link to the quick pickled red onions and I only found the list of ingredients but I didn't find the process of making them. Would you please let me know what I need to do? Thank you!",
				"Made these tonight and they were incredible!! Tip: cut the mushrooms lengthways, lay flat side down then shred. So much easier than fumbling and bruising the mushroom. Such a satisfying feeling hahaha",
				"Quick question: I live in the United States and I'm not sure what the difference between the oven temperatures for \"fan function vs fan setting\".  I just have a regular oven and I'm stumped. Not sure which temp to go with... Any clarification would be greatly appreciated. :)",
				"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!This recipe is the proof that tacos can be as good as the classic ones with meat IF NOT BETTERJust got into the plant based lifestyle and will definitely make more of your recipes.Best regards",
				"I am not a vegan but am slowly transitioning to more vegan/vegetarian food and this is one of my absolute favourite recipes! I've made it loads of times and even my meat-obsessed dad LOVED it!",
				"Thank you so much for your fast reply! I\u2019m off to the grocery store right now!",
				"I\u2019m EXCITED to try this recipe for a gathering where there will be a lot of vegans.  I have bought all the ingredients and I\u2019m ready to go except for the mushrooms.  I\u2019ve called all the local grocery stores and none of them have oyster mushrooms, king or smaller sizes\u2026  what do you think is the most ideal substitute mushroom?",
				"I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to have found this delicious recipe. It screams umami and I'm completely addicted! Thank you!",
				"I have been on the look out for a good pulled mushroom recipe for ages now. So pleased to stumble uopn yours. I haven\u2019t tried it yet, but do you think the pulled mushrooms would work on their own as a side dish?  Thank you.",
				"This was SO good that I was genuinely a bit upset when I finished it!",
				"This was amazing. It was to follow and cook. And the taste was great. I didn\u00b4t have the same oyster mushrooms as you, mine were much smaller but I guess the texture is much the same for both. I will do this again and again and again. Thank you.",
				"Ania, I tried this recipe. Without getting into expletives this was fantastic. I upped the adobo paste, as I enjoy spicy foods, and it was all I could do not to finish off the entire dish. Wonderful flavor and texture, my mushrooms were on the long side (6\" maybe a tad longer) next time I might cut those a bit shorter in length to make it more manageable to eat. My wife and I loved it. You have a winner here, with lots of opportunity to make this a bardeque dish as well. Thanks for posting in Pinterest! AJ and Jann Gest Denver Colorado.",
				"I made these for dinner tonight, oh my goodness! They were about the best vegan dinner I have ever made, possibly that I have ever eaten! Thank you for sharing the recipe. I\u2019m so glad that I found it!",
				"I used baby bellas and portabello mushrooms since that was what I had on hand.  I have to say this was amazing.  Soooooo good.  They were devoured.",
				"These went up like a house on fire. Thanks for an amazing recipe!",
				"Omgoodness, these were just fabulous!  I couldn\u2019t find the mushrooms you used so I used portobellos.  We just finished up and now I\u2019m making another batch,Thanks  again.",
				"loved it!!!!",
				"These look amazing! But where I live I have never seen these huge oyster mushrooms... would this work with regular oyster mushrooms? or would they be too small to \"pull\"?",
				"Thank you the glossary  will be very helpful",
				"Ania, these look delicious! If my Asian store sold king oyster mushrooms... I've been on the lookout for these for a while now :/I have a question, sort of a recipe request. Would you consider developing a seitan recipe for Polish-style ham (szynka)? I have looked around and found a few recipes but they are not very convincing. I thought I'd leav this here! Hope you're having a great long weekend so far :)",
				"Wow, this is brilliant! I haven't seen oyster mushrooms here in Jura, but I'll keep my eyes peeled. Gorgeous photos, as always."

And it is delicious! So glad I did an impromptu forage session when I was out walking the dog.All the recipes on this blog that I have tried have been absolutely incredible \ud83d\ude4c 10/10",
				"I made this with cashew nuts and pumpkin seed oil because I didn't have pumpkin seeds and it was super yummy, better than any shop bought pesto that I've tried!",
				"Made for my family, 3 of which eat meat and dairy and are not always happy to eat my vegan food! However, all agreed it was really tasty and the Parm was not missed a bit. Super simple and quick to make and I personally loved the sub of pumpkin seeds for pine nuts. Will definitely be making in the future.",
				"I made this with pine nuts, but everything else as per the recipie. It suppased my expectations and was so delicious. Thank you",

I have a lot of wild garlic leftover though, any other uses for it, you think?Also, funnily enough, my Italian friend/housemate h a t e s garlic. \ud83e\udd23 I'm like, \"but you're Italian!\" Hehe.",

				"Great recipe thank you!Really delicious flavours and affordable with pumpkin seeds",
				"Delicious recipe, even though I made it with macadamia nuts and no nutritional yeast - our cupboards are quite bare at the moment! Also added about a teaspoon of Umeboshi paste as I\u2019ve seen other vegan pesto recipes use this - really gives it a salty, umami tang. Just bear in mind you likely won\u2019t need extra salt if you use this. Thanks, Ania!",
				"I'm in love with this! Weve had it with pasta, stirred through cooked peas and just had some on a poached egg with spinach on toast. Scrummy! I'm trying  to work a way of preserving  so we can  have this delight through the year. If I sterilised jars fill to the top and top with olive oil, seal and keep cool and dark what do you think the chances are if the oil has a long shelf life?.... x",

The extra bite from the chillies is good. I served it with roasted pine nuts and grated Vegan hard scheese. Fantastic, I'm making more already. Definately worth a full 5 stars! Well done Ania.",

I did not have butternut so I added sweet potato instead...Also sadly could not wait to order preserved lemon and so had to make due with salt and a little lemon juice.  Still very tasty.   And beautiful.I added 2 tbsp or so of sunflower seed butter and it made the tagine taste richer!",

				"Sugar isn't listed in the ingredients",
				"What a great recipe! The addition of buckwheat flour caught my eye, because I hadn't tried it in baked goods before. Being of Indian heritage, I had only ever seen buckwheat flour used in savoury dishes like stuffed parathas. I was a bit hesitant, so I used 1 cup buckwheat and 0.5 cups plain flour. I did not have coconut or demerera in the pantry, so I used regular brown sugar. I also skipped the banana on top, but tipped in a handful of raspberries (in season in Australia atm) and a handful of toasted pecans. The bread has these lovely crispy edges and the texture is perfect too, but what I loved the most is the rich nuttiness of the buckwheat flour itself. Next bake, I will definitely go with 100% buckwheat. I did not feel the need for a glaze, as it was intended to be a breakfast bread rather than an indulgent cake. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",
				"Ah! I didn't know buckwheat was also used in Polish savoury dishes. I just found a recipe for a vegetarian version of Go\u0142\u0105bki with mushrooms and buckwheat groats.  I have tried and loved the pork version in my meat-eating days, so can't wait to try this!",

The banana bread wasn\u2019t too sweet, so I could top it with some maple tahini without it becoming dessert-sweet (aka perfect for snacks!)",
				"This recipe sounds perfect for me then! I love moist banana bread. I've had the misfortune of trying a few recipes that were awkwardly dry and needed to be toasted (similar to cinnamon raisin bread).I'll pick up some bananas this weekend and let you know how it goes once they ripen!",
				"I can't tell from the pictures, is this banana bread more similar to bread or cake?",
				"Made it! Delicious! Super moist! A keeper !  I have an egg allergy so I'm glad for this recipe. No one asked, they just ate and ate. I added hazelnut and almond chocolate bars roughly chopped  out of habit.  Next time I will try adding other  tidbits like oreos or marshmallows or cream cheese filling.Thanks!",
				"My go to recipe!!! I've been using this recipe religiously for about a year now, I've tried other ones and I always come back to this. I've tried some variations, adding nuts, rolled oats, it all works really well! I'm not vegan myself but my sister is allergic to eggs and honestly even if i was baking for a non vegan or someone who can eat eggs, i'd just make this one because it tastes banging!",
				"Hi, thank you so much for your recipe. May I know if I can replace buckwheat flour with all purpose flour?",
				"Hi Ania! Have you tried making this oil free?",
				"Thanks so much! It probably won\u2019t last 4 days anyway! \ud83d\ude03",
				"Hello, this banana bread is sooo good! Really moist and fluffy. Thanks for the recipe! It\u2019s def my go to from now on! Can I just ask how I should store it and how long it lasts? Thanks so much!",
				"Hi Ania I love your blog so much. This is my first time commenting but I have been using your recipes for 3 years. Such precise instructions and beautiful photography, thank you for putting so much care into the site. All the recipes I have ever made turned out really well. Your laksa, imam biyaldi and lasagna have all been demolished by dinner guests, and I have returned to this banana bread many times over lock down. Cheers :)",
				"This banana bread turned out perfectly! It is soft, moist and delicious! Since 2020 has brought a lot of time at home, I have been baking lots and banana bread has been a regular occurrence. I have tried a number of recipes and this is the best one yet! Highly recommend this recipe and even better, it\u2019s healthy and packed with goodness! And no animals were harmed in the process ;)",
				"WOW!!!!! AMAZIBG RECEPIE TURNED OUT ABSLUTLEY PERFECT !  Amazing texture and taste. I recommend muahing up the banana really well and making sure you leave it in the oven a good 8 min after the scewer is out clean to dry it up a bit so ita not mushy.One of the best i tasted!",
				":)What to modify if I want to make cupcakes out of this recipe? Planning to experiment something.",
				"Thank you. In some recipes the pre heat temperature and baking temp is different, hence the confusion.But you should know the cake turned out great, will be making it second time tomorrow. Will be trying one version without sugar and one without sugar banana, lets see how it turns out.If only i could post the picture here!  Try this link: https://ibb.co/34r7zxN and ktell me what you think!Another shot: https://ibb.co/LzZpdgCMy mom loved it, thank you!",
				"Hi, what is the baking temperature for this?",
				"I must say this recipe is amazing and i will most certainly be makimg again, had two bunchs of bananas to use up and made 2 banana breads, flavours are lovely just the right amount of sweetness as my bananas were  covered in black spots so very nearlly over ripe, I wonder if you have a rough chart of nutritional information as i do like to track my intake? Thanks again!",
				"Thanks for sharing the recipe. It was delicious! I love how moist the bread is without using eggs. I reduced the sugar to 90g and found it perfect.",
				"Perfect banana bread",
				"Hey.. I loved your recipe...and my family Loved having it.. Just one doubt.. The cake went flat when cooked down.. But it did rise so well while it was baking.. I mean the cake rose nice dome like a loaf on all sides while baking n had lovely cracks too but it slowly became little flat when switched off the oven n kept to cool.. It didn't sink.. Just deflated a little on all sides tlll the top level of the mould.. Hope I made u understand my doubt well..",
				"Do I have to use the lemon or lime?",
				"When I first made this it came out well and was very delicious but afterwards my second and third ones were too sweet and the batter wasn't cooked well even though I baked almost an hour! So I checked your recipe again and read the comments, then I found it! I measured the banana without peels from my second time because I got an electric food scale LOL Now I cannot wait to make this again for the fourth time! Wish me luck ;) Oh one question! If I want to make a half batch of this recipe, should I still bake for 50-55min?Thank you Ania for all your amazing work! I really enjoy to try your recipes :) Soyoon from Korea",
				":( followed the recipe but my banana bread turned out kinda mushy, with most of the mashed banana at the bottom. Tastes great but, any idea what might have happened so that I can make attempt again and make a better one?  :\u2019(",

				"So  Ania, you set yourself the challenge to produce a dish \u201cpacked with texture and flavour\u201d. Boom! This is a dish that needs to be experienced rather than described, so I\u2019m just going to thank you for this amazing recipe. The dressing in particular is stunning and one I\u2019ll be using in different contexts - if that\u2019s okay! Gochujang can be a bit of a bully, but your use of it in the tofu and the dressing is inspired. Thanks again, best wishes, Paolo",
				"Made this tonight and it was delicious! Nice and easy to make too.",
				"I got a huge Daikon Raddish in my Oddbox, and wasn't sure what to do. I combined a recipe from Oddbox with this *amazing* recipe for two days of stunning bibimbap lunch bowls. I swapped a few elements to what I had at home, so easy to do that with this recipe. Used quinoa instead of rice, but look  forward to trying it with rice next time. Added a little gochugaru to my pickling radish to spice it up.Delicious! thank you.",
				"Hi. It says serves 2-3 which is a shame as I would love to cook this but need to stick to strict guidance on food amounts for an anorexic child",
				"A go-to in our house that we have made numerous times for numerous people who have all asked where the recipe is from! So tasty and tastes so fresh with all the vegetables. Thank you for such a fabulous recipe!",
				"I love this recipe so much. I've made it several times and it is perfect. I like to batch cook my meals at the start of the week, and this is a great recipe for that. I prep all the veggies, then just cook the rice each day. The pickles are delicious, and the sauce is a nice alternative to tahini based ones. Can't recommend this one enough \ud83d\ude0b",
				"you saved my evening, Anya. I didn't think I even had the energy to cook but I managed this and it was delicious and just what I needed. thank you!",
				"I made a version of this because I had the Gochikamg and tofu in the house but no mushrooms or spinach. I baked the tofu and it was fine. I have sweet potatoes in the house so I roasted some  small cubes after ridding in the dressing. I happened to have some quinoa already made so I used that instead of rice. It turned out very well and we enjoyed it, especially the dressing.",
				"The dressing was so good!! It definitely tastes like the bibimbap my mom and I had at a Korean restaurant weeks ago \ud83d\ude0b the only thing that didn't workout for me was the tofu marinade; I find it a little bit on the salty side. I think instead of adding 4 tsp of soy sauce, I'll try adding just 2 or maybe even 1 tsp and just add more hot pepper paste. Overall, I really like the dressing and I'll try making it again sometime soon :)",
				"This is an exceptional recipe, full of flavour, easy to make and very healthy. I thoroughly recommend it to everybody. I think this is the best Korean-inspired food that I've ever made.",
				"Great recipe! Made a lot of people happy with this vegan dish the other night. Looking forward to try out some other recipes of yours.",
				"AMAZING, DELICIOUS, PERFECT. MAKE IT!",
				"Delicious and really beautiful bowl!! Thanks for the great recipe!!",
				"Made this the other night with a meat substitute, instead of tofu. Really great recipe that's so easy to prepare & it tastes amazing! THANKS!",
				"Thanks for a veggie version of this dish.it looks very good. I\u2019ll try it with tempeh as I don\u2019t like tofu at all.",
				"This sounds delicious, but I'm confused about the rice...you don't mention when/where to add it. I'm guessing it should be hot and added to the bowls. I haven't had bibimbap in years and don't exactly remember the configuration. Thanks for clarification. :)",
				"I made this and it was awesome! It\u2019s completely different from the other recipes I use, so it is a welcome pleasure. Thank you! Your recipes have so much flavor.",
				"Love this recipe! The prep time is way off if you factor in pressing the tofu, making the pickled daikon, and marinating the tofu. Otherwise the flavors were fantastic! Spicy, crunchy, savory \u2764\ufe0f",
				"This was really delicious. I found it a bit salty so I don't think I would add any salt if making it again. I'm not vegan but would happily make this a regular weekly meal. I replaced the daikon with carrot, used smoked tofu cooked in the oven and for veg finely shredded stir fried sprouts.",
				"Wow! This recipe is one of the best I've made in a long time. My husband actually stopped dinner to have everyone give me a compliment on the meal!!!",
				"This is amazing!! Better than at the restaurant! Thanks for the recipe, gonna make it again this week",
				"I just read your \"about us\" page. I didn't realize you'd lived in Paros. On our honeymoon 34 years ago, my husband and I went to Italy and Greece. We'd just graduated from architecture school, and we visited many beautiful buildings and architectural sites, but we spent the last week of our trip on Paros. We stayed in a little pensione and rented a Vespa to get to the beach and back.. It was so wonderful we never wanted to leave. I hope your transition back to the UK has been a good one.",
				"I made this tonight, exactly as written (I baked the marinated tofu because I like it chewy), and it was SO good!!!  I briefly considered putting a fried egg over it (which I know would make it not-vegan), but in the end I decided not to, and I'm so glad I didn't--I didn't miss it at all! Thank you for a great recipe!",
				"I made this on Friday for my boyfriend who is gluten/grain/starch free, and was stoked with how delicious and hearty it is! So good I am doing it again just a couple of nights later for a dinner party (and turns out someone is gf so I am glad I chose something that works for her). Looking forward to trying more of your recipes!Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
				"Made this twice now - really delicious - loved by all the family.  Didn't have gochujang sauce so used  sriracha instead and made an amai sauce for the kids. So, so good could eat this every day.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.",
				"Um, this looks delicious. Can't wait to try! Also...LOVE your logo \ud83d\udc4c",
				"I made this for some non-vegan friends and it was a huge hit!  (But I can't find a way to post a pic.)  So tasty.  I added a little avocado because I've gotten it that way before and since the real deal often comes with an egg on top, I figured that'd be a nice substitute.  Thanks for sharing this deliciousness!",
				"I clicked the link to the Gochujang you use, read the ingredients list, and found that it contains wheat, so not GF. Important info for Celiacs like me. Is there an alternative you could recommend ? I assume this paste is essential for an authentic taste in this recipe.",
				"I saved this on Facebook when you first posted it, and have been meaning to make it for some time - it looks incredible. However, this kind of dish is completely new to me. Of the 60-120 ml of water for the rice vinegar mix, how much would you recommend that a beginner start with (who is just starting to explore this kind of cuisine) to discover the flavours etc.?Also, I'm not into a lot of spicy/hot foots, I prefer things mild. Would 1/4 tsp of the Gochujang be enough to add flavour without too much heat?TIA :-)",
				"I'm so in love with your recipe, especially the gochujang sauce. Try to find out the sauce to eat along but couldn't. Thank you sooooo much! You make my day!",
				"So great! We have a very good asian restaurant in L\u00fcbeck that sells amazing Bibimbap and I wanted to make it at home! I really have to try this!",
				"wow - this looks so good! it's definitely going on my menu for next week.",
				"Tried it today and it was very tasty (and indeed, foolproof)! I didn't have the chance to try the pickled daikon - they didn't have any daikons or radishes at the store - but I'll definitely add it next time.",
				"This bibimbap looks so tasty, it's hard to find restaurants with great food, but at least you got inspired to create this amazing recipe",
				"Oh, this so funny! We are just in Korea for vacation and it is really difficult tovget a vegan dish. Nearly everything is either with meat or fish. So I will try your recipe as soon as I am back at home. Thanks for this nice inspiration!",
				"Ania, are you making ALL your recipes for me? \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0aI'm in love with EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM! And I have a thing for Asian / Korean inspired food lately and I just made some quick pickled veggies the other day, inspired by you. Perfect timing, can't wait to dive into my pickled daikon jar and try this one too!!!Thank you for the endless inspiration \ud83d\udc9b",

				"These are so delicious! I only had about 2/3 cup quinoa so I added 1/3 cup ground rolled oats and they turned out super yummy! And my 6 year old fussy eater loved them too. Thanks!",
				"Tried to make these and they turned out great! Do you know how many calories are in each cookie?",
				"I just finished making these cookies and in typical form I did not read your recipe correctly so instead of  nuts OR Quinoa I used both and as I did not have hazelnust I used almonds instead, well I must say if I had not caught my mistake I would have thought that was how they were meant to feel and taste, quite satisfying, thank you.Annette",
				"I did that, rinsed it very well before cooking. Will make them soon again :) Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hi. I've made this recipe with quinoa. They are sssoooo good!Only that it was quite difficult to use the composition. I have added 1 spoon of flour to make it a little less complicated to use. It was really sticky, it got on my hands and on the spoon, it hardly remained in the tray. I hope I'll do better next time :)My question actually is Do you know if quinoa served like this is ok for kids? We have only boiled it so far. Never raw and fried. Thank you",
				"These are delicious! So simple to make and yet the perfect mix of crispy and chewy. Amazing!",
				"Thank you for this recipe! I made the hazelnut version and I have never eaten better cookies in my life! Thank you so much :)",
				"Thank you for helping me out! You might be right about my raw cacao powder - I will definitely follow your advice with the quinoa version; first I will try the hazelnut version. Sorry, but I have just one more question - I feel like 'Columbo' in the detective serie :) : what do you think that roasting the hazelnuts before grinding them would do to the resulting cookies?",
				"I  don't think I burnt the cookies nor the quinoa (I don't like my cookies or bread dark) and my mother didn't find them bitter so it must definitely be my palate : )",
				"Hi,this sounds very interesting but a bit scary to me. I have never tried eating quinoa in this form. Are you sure it's not too gritty and teeth breaking?",
				"I made them with quinoa and they are indeed crunchy! I followed the recipe, but even with the quinoa being toasted, I find the cookies taste bitter and not sweet at all (maple syrup is there but doesn't help to sweeten it up?) - or am I mistaken? I think I will try them with the hazelnuts - you didn't roast these first (for added flavor)?",
				"If you can work out how to do GF,  vegan Yorkshire puddings I'm all ears!",
				"Made these cookies last night with ginger powder and kosher salt on top, everyone loved them both vegan and non-vegan in my household. I used hazelnut  version. I also liked that it was only a few ingredients.",
				"Made them with orange zest and a few drops of orange EO and love the result! So crunchy! Do you think I could swap the quinoa for millet or buckwheat groats in the future? I have tons in my pantry and this seems like a great recipe to \u201csmuggle\u201d them in ;)",
				"Would this recipe work with raw millet or raw buckwheat groats instead of the raw quinoa, and, would I have to grind the buckwheat first because it's larger than millet and quinoa? Also, is it safe to eat quinoa, millet and buckwheat like that, just toasted (without cooking or soaking)?",
				"Omg this is oil free and crunchy??? I have to make these tomorrow (with the quinoa)",
				"are you serious about wanting ideas for recipes?  if so i would love to have a recipe for a healthy savory quick bread that was vegan.   that perhaps has some wheat germ and herbs in it.   I had something like that in my pre-vegan days and would love to have  healthier version that i could put some nut butter on and throw in my pack for a day of hiking or along side a nice seasonal salad.Thanks for considering",
				"Yum. This looks sooo good! I only have cocoa powder though... would that be okay instead of cacao?I will make it and return to rate the recipe (5 stars, I'm sure)You asked for a recipe to veganise: beef rendangIt would be SO amazing if you could get a vegan rendang with the same sort of texture and aromas. Really miss this dishAlso... Pakistani Saag Gosht (Rapini, Spinach, Red Meat). Or Halwa Kadoo Gosht (Pumpkin and Red Meat)I could SO go on, but I think this is enough for now \ud83d\ude0aThank you for an amazing site and your hard work \ud83d\udc95",
				"Thank you for getting my ESP signals from the U.S.! Seems it only took a week for them to reach you as last week at this time, I was searching for a healthy chocolate cookie recipe. Ended up just mixing some oatmeal, cocoa powder, and peanut butter for a no-bake treat, but now I have a recipe for an Ania cookie which will be much better than anything I could have created. The weekend is looking much brighter already as these look yummy."

As in one coment you mentioned it has to be refrigerated so it doesn't mold, now I am unsure about it.I would love to know your opinion on making the switch of ingredients.Thanks,Steph",
				"We lived in the Middle East for 5 years and loved eating all kinds of dates (hundreds of varieties) and using the date syrup in our hot cocoa. The sweetest dates I ever tried in Oman were Sukari Dates and I was able to find them in a store in Calgary and man I love eating them right out of the container like a little piggy. I thank you so much for posting how to make date syrup and I think I will give it a try with the Sukari Dates. Awesome!!",
				"Do you put the water from cooking into the bag along with the dates when you strain?  Or do you just put the fruits?",
				"Hi Ania,A quick question wrt the date syrup...Once it has cooked for about 2 hours, do you only use the liquid extracted from the actual dates )with the cheese cloth) or do you also add the left over liquid that is still in the saucepan , to the concentrate?",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks so much for this recipe.I made mine nearly 3 weeks ago, and have left it outside of the refrigerator as an experiment.  Still  beautiful ..colour, consistency,  taste etc.Thanks again...Ps.... I have tried about 8 or 10 of your recipes already..and living them allThanks sooo much.",
				"Hi! Just wanned to say big thanks for this recipe! It worked perfect,  though I messed it up a bit when squeezing the dates  as I decided to use the slow juicer \ud83d\ude48  unfortunately,  the dates stucked up in the upper part  and no juice would come out.  Yeah, I learnt something  :)) As for the pulp I will use  it  in home made \"nutella\"  recipe\ud83d\ude0aBTW I used the  mazafati dates, 600g of which, where I live,  cost about the same as the ready made  SILAN, but  I still prefer to have it home made :)",
				"Hi, thanks for this recipe!!  What impurities are we removing by doing the first 20min soak?  I googled 'date impurities' and 'why do you have to soak dates for impurities,' but couldn't find anything (and now am concerned).  Thanks for all your work.",
				"How much syrup did you get from 1 lb of dates?",
				"Thank you Ania for sharing, so kind of you.  I bought date syrup recently at Winners, and I'm loving it, so I'm definitely making it when I run out! I wanted to ask you, how much syrup is this recipe supposed to yield?",
				"Mix date syrup with tahini and eat it as a dip with pitta bread. One great winter snack.",
				"Great recipe Ania. Will try itThanks.",
				"Amazing!! Thank you so much for sharing such a healthy recipe! I can\u2019t wait to make this :)",
				"Goodness me, you put out a great sounding recipe for a delicious syrup and all people can do is challenge you?!  Date syrup is great, works in so many things and has an excellent flavour. I like date puree also but for certain things (pancakes) you can't beat the flavour of syrup.  Yes maple syrup is tasty and relative to other sugars, also a decent choice but it is prohibitively expensive in some places or for some people.I am excited to try this, I need to get a cloth to filter the dates through first though.  Thank you so much for sharing as it sounds perfect.",
				"Hi there, thank you for the recipe. Do you do something with the remains of the dates? Do you use them for any other recipe?",
				"Could I use instant pot (5 min) to reduce slow cooking of 2 hours Thanks for yr advise",
				"I am making it today will let you know how it turned out.",
				"Thanks for this recipe. The syrup was lovely and I used for your Baclava recipe- it was lovely to eat some thing sweet but not sickly. Now thinking what to do with the pulp as it seems a waste just to bin it. Thanks again.",
				"Hi,Thanks for the postI prepared my date syrup last week and realized that it's fermented this week although I didn't refrigerateWhat should be doneWas it that it wasn't thick enoughThanks",
				"Hi i wanted to ask if you remove the skin of the dates before putting them in boiling water or do you just pit them? Also can I use mazafati dates?",
				"This was lovely. I used a nut milk bag to strain. Plan to drizzle on a warm eggplant salad with walnuts. :-)",
				"Made a batch . . . it is wonderful!Inspired by Spiced Silan Boubon Cocktail recipe in Adeena Sussman's book \"sababa\".",
				"Thanks for this recipe! I wanted to bake something with my hard-as-rock dates lol, and knew I\u2019d need to boil them to soften them up first. So I looked up ways I could make use of the water in which I boiled the dates, and I came across your article. This is just great! Thanks.",
				"Great recipe ! What did you do with the dates?",
				"For the first step of soaking, do you mean to say that we should soak in boiled water? Or we should boil the dates for 20 minutes?",
				"Looking forward to making this soon! Thanks so much.",
				"I blitzed the cooked date mixture in my Vitamix for one minute before straining out the liquid through the cheesecloth. The pulp remaining in the cheesecloth makes a superb spread on toast with butter. Also on crackers etc.",
				"If you follow Dr Greger, or even just watched the video you refer to for healthy sweeteners, you would know that your date syrup is not comparable to the whole date  puree he describes. Date puree , or date sugar, that he recommends is the whole date. Your date syrup removes all the fiber that makes dates his recommended sweetener.You should not be alluding that  date syrup is complient with Dr Gregers  recommendations for whole food plant based diets",
				"thanks ...",

				"Hi Ania,Thanks for the instructions on making date syrup at home. I did it and the syrup turned our great and some of my friends have also learnt from you. Thanks a lot and keep up the good work.",
				"Hi Ania, what will happen if the dates were cooked more than 2 hours (step 3)?",
				"Hello, I'm really looking forward to try this recipe, but I have one question - you advise to keep it in a glass jar, but I once bought date syrup in a plastic one and I'd like to use it, does it make any differnece? Apart from ecological reason, of course.",
				"Well done!Nicely written procedure. It led to the expected end.The syrup came out really nice. I am leaving it unrefrigerated to know how long it keeps. This is because I haven't seen any information online that talked about preserving without refrigeration. Plus, irregular power supply patterns in the tropics and developing countries doesn't encourage refrigeration. In all, well done Ania!",
				"Glad you linked a video to your recipe but i was talking about the fact that maple syrup is not bad for the health.  A video showing me how to do the date syrup is not a source for that.I made a lot of research on sugar for my radio show and i can assure you that maple syrup is not bad and is the only one that doesn't make the sugar level go up in the body.  Didn't know about the date sirup before so i don't know about it for the sugar level but you shouldn't put down the maple syrup as it is also a good way of sweetening something",
				"I don't quite get the idea of boiling  the dates first to get rid of the impurities...what impurities?  Does that  water not take a lot of the sugar with  it?   As to the  nourishing value of sweeteners like maple, honey, agave etc I really don't worry about it much as sweeteners are never used for their nutritional value.  My go to though is molasses ans love the stuff.  Agave and honey to have the value of a lower glycemic index.Good site...keep up the good work!",
				"Nice web design ........ Thanks for sharing",
				"Hi I was curious to know about the nutritional fact. Through this process like heating and simmering do the nutritional fact reduce anyway. Thanks for the elaborate process written. Irin",
				"Thank you for your posts! How long will this last ? Is it shelf stable?",
				"I wonder where you got the idea that maple sirup is not good for the health... it's the only one that doesn't even change the sugar level in the body and contains lots of mineralsI love the idea of the date sugar because it might be cheaper to make it than to buy maple sugar, but you should research about the maple sirup more",
				"What can you do with the date pulp?",
				"Just to clarify, do you boil water and then remove from heat and soak the dates, or are we boiling the water while soaking?",
				"This looks great!Any idea how long this will keep if refrigerated?",
				"The only two types of sugar that fare substantially better than others are date sugar and blackstrap molasses. The fact that date sugar proved to be a darling of this comparison isn\u2019t too surprising given that date sugar is essentially dehydrated and ground up dates. It is pretty pricey and not easy to get hold of, so I\u2019m not rushing to switch to it just yet, especially that it doesn\u2019t dissolve or melt like regular sugar so it doesn\u2019t work so well in baking, for example.Date syrup, on the other hand, is suitable for baking and as it\u2019s also extracted from dates it shares some of date sugar\u2019s nutritional properties. I'm not following the above.  Is date syrup okay for baking or not?? In one paragraph it is and the other it isn't"

				"Hi thanks for the recipe I liked the vegan bolognese and going to try this next... Can I use the leftover cooked chickpeas from making the aquafaba to make hummus?",
				"Absolutely awesome! Made this twice now and it\u2019s fast becoming a weekly favourite in our house, love the flavours and textures!  Thank you \ud83d\ude4f",
				"yum! sorry you had a bad experience at the restaurant, but i'm glad it inspired you to create this delicious-looking dish!",
				"This recipe was amazing! Thank you so much! Is it possible to freeze the curry sauce? As I have heaps left over. Will definitely be making more if your dishes \ud83d\ude0d",
				"How do you get the tofu shape in your images? Do you slice through the tofu horizontally? That would seem to make verrrry thin tofu.It may be that tofu is packaged in the US differently, I don't know...Thanks!",
				"Just served  this up to my  Japonphile family....total success! Lovely recipe, really enjoyed eating and making it. Thank you!!",
				"Dear Ania, and a nice recipe from you which was a full success at home when I made it tonight! The sauce is simple but very good. Never thaought that an apple and carrots would give such nice flavours and texture. I made the tofu with corn flour, I have no possibility to use the chickpeas cause we go on vacation tomorrow. But will try this next time definitely! Great, delicious and good meal, thanks! My daughter liked it as well and she hates cooked carrots. ; )",
				"I made this  tonight and we loved it! The sauce is perfectly balanced and goes so nicely with the  crispy fried tofu . I'll definitely make it again.",
				"Do you think its possible to try baking the tofu instead of pan frying it? Love this recipe a lot though, curry is one of my favorite foods and being able to see a vegan recipe for a meatless version, (with tofu - which I LOVE), makes me very happy! :D",
				"Do you have the nutrition facts for this recipe? It looks sooo good but I am currently counting macros and would like to know how it would fit in.",
				"That's great to hear, what an excellent decision you both made to move on.. and so few of us have had the guts and imagination to live the dream of an 'idyllic island'. However much we might fantasise about it.",
				"You may have left the vivid Greek light Ania but your  photography has lost none of its eye popping colour and brilliance! Hope Duncan's and your health problems are fully resolved in the UK setting.",
				"So smart to use aquafaba to coat the tofu! This dish looks so delicious Ania!",
				"OMG! You read my mind. The other night my Omni Japanese husband made vegan curry and he added tonkatsu for himself. I was thinking  that there had to be a way to make it with tofu and here it is! Can\u2019t wait to try this, thank you!"

				"I have made quite a few of your recipes which have received praise from vegan and non vegans alike. Please keep your blog going.  It\u2019s been a life line for me. My question is about this lemon drizzle cake. I have to make it gluten free but I have read in other recipes to add xantham gum if using gluten free flour to help stabilise the mixture. Should I add it to this recipe?  Thank you once again for your lovely blog",

				"Thank you, this recipe looks delicious - can\u2019t wait to try it! Do you think it would still work if I substituted oranges for lemons in a one to one swap?",
				"Loved this recipe! I baked it with my partner, who has never baked  before, over Zoom and ours both came out beautifully! Great for first time vegan bakers and the coconut oil can be substituted with any flavourless vegetable oil with similar results i've found! The sponge is light and fluffy but moist where the drizzle soaks in. I used a chopstick for the holes and had to cover the dents with lemon zest for photos afterwards so I recommend following the advice of a toothpick or cocktail stick for small barely visible holes. I can't get enough of the rosemary either - such a beautifully paired flavour :))",

				"One if the best lemon cakes!!! Thank you Aniu!",
				"I am hoping to make this cake but will need to make a day in advance. Do you recommend waiting to ice it until Serving ? Should I also wait to use the syrup ? Any advise on whether to keep it in a cooler or not would also be appreciated !  We are going camping and it will be a surprise for my partners bday :)  thanks so much !",
				"I have made this recipe twice, once gluten-free and once with standard flour. Both times it was delicious. I think the texture was ever so slightly denser than I would want and I'm trying to figure out if it's because of the sugar I'm using. I only have powdered sugar and granulated sugar available here, it seems caster sugar is somewhat in the middle of those two. I have been using 50:50 of each by weight, but maybe one or the other would work better? Would really appreciate any thoughts you have.",
				"Hi Ania,Thank you for this fantastic recpie. I've made it numerous times and even put my own spin on it by doubling the cake recipe which makes two lemon rosemary sponge cakes and then I iced it with lemon buttercream. So good! I just noticed the cake crumbles quite a bit, as do a lot of vegan cakes. Do you have any ideas on how to make it hold together a little better?  Thanks!",
				"Hi ,Loved the recipe ..looks great will try it tomorrow . Can u pls tell me what can i use for the glaze as i dont have icing sugar ...can it be replaced with any other type of sugar.. may be crystal sugar powdered  ??? Pls advice i really want to bake one soon. Love Kanika",
				"This is so delicious!  I made it for my book club because one of us is vegan.  I make another dessert as well, but this was the definite favorite.  Several members asked for the recipe.  Since then I have made it many times and it is always a hit.  Thanks",
				"Absolutely delicious! This was a hit! I grounded the almonds myself  so they came out a bit chunky and therefore the cake was a little crumbly and stodgy in places. Before serving I sliced it then added it to a warm pan to gently caramelise. Absolutely yummy, thank you for sharing x",
				"Hi Ania,Thank you for posting this recipe.This was my first time baking a vegan cake. It tastes lovely and is very fluffy. However, although I left the cake in the oven (160 C fun-assisted) for 50 minutes and the toothpick came out clean, it felt very heavy and fragile after coming out of the tin. When I sliced it it was too moist inside - not sure if this was because of the syrup or because I didn't bake it long enough. I put it back in the oven just now - hopefully it will be okay.I will definitely try baking it again - maybe leave it in the oven for longer next time.Thank you,Ana",
				"Your recipe sounds delicious! Can\u2019t wait to try it. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have plant/almond on me and stepping out isn\u2019t an option at the moment. Can I use normal milk instead? And If so, would the quantity be the same?",
				"This was absolutely delicious! I am dairy and egg intolerant which often means I can\u2019t eat cake often so I have been dying to try this recipe. It was so moist, tangy and delicious. My boyfriend  absolutely loved it too. It was so moist that it was a bit more pudding like and I used a spoon. I didn\u2019t use the icing and next time I make it, I\u2019ll do less syrup as it was probably a bit too much sugar but seriously good!! Definitely recommend",
				"What substitute flour could you use and what quantities? Would.like to be as paleo as possible.Thanks",
				"Great recipe! I made this cake today and I love it. I made only small modifications, such as reducing the amount of sugar and using sunflower oil instead of coconut oil.  I only had whole almonds at hand and I finely ground them. I believe that made the cake a bit more crumbly and easy to fall apart. I doesn't seem as dense as the one on your pictures is. BUT, it is really light and soft, perfectly baked and that lemon kick that you get at the end from the lemon syrup is just fantastic!",
				"Hi. I wonder what you mean with \"not from the fridge\" does this mean the longlife carton type milk?",
				"Hi Ania125g sugar and 1/2 cup don\u2019t seem to be the same?  125g is working out at 1 cup for me.",
				"Hello Ania, you suggested in one of the comments above that a neutral oil could be used instead of the coconut oil - how much neutral oil would you use?(For the solid coconut oil the measurement is 100g)Thank you",
				"I just tried this cake and it's absolutely delicious! I added some almond extract, which really kicked up the almond flavor. I am thinking of trying to make a lower calorie version of this cake - do you think it would be possible to sub half of the coconut oil for applesauce (this is something I sometimes do with banana bread to cut calories/fat down), and perhaps omit some of the ground almonds in favor of almond extract?",
				"Thank you, Ania. To be honest, this would be my first time freezing a cake. So, I bake it normally, freeze it and to unfreeze re-bake another 10minutes with the original temperature? Would be a pity to waste this amazing cake due to a wrong unfreezing method ;)Best regardsCaroline"

I steamed them as they were a bit old and thought this would make them less dehydrated.  Rather than use onions I also had a couple of leeks that I used in place of them. I used my high speed blender to bring it all together. It makes a delicious smooth soup which I served with seeds and some broccoli sprouts for a fresh nutritious crunch. Yummy!",
				"Made the soup on the weekend. I love roast parsnip but the soup was a little unfamiliar , taste-wise, to me. Kind of tart and a little too veggie tasting. I added extra miso  paste and it came together really nicely. I would just adjust the miso at the end rather than add anything else. I recommend highly! (served toasted paleo bread with the soup)",

Would you suggest to swap the baking powder and soda maybe on my next trial?Also - I had applesauce I had to use up so I ended up swapping 40g of the oil into appleasauce and then using an additional 20g rapeseed oil!

Thanks so much for putting the science out there and linking to Dr. Greger, I never knew about this information before and it's great to have in one's knowledge base on nutrition. :) Back to the recipe -- YUM!! This was so good and quick to make for a lazy weekday lunch. I halved the spices and ommited the chili so that I could share with my 2 year old, and it turned out so delicious and fulfilling. We ate it mixed with shredded spinach and a good dose of lime juice (vit C decreases oxalates in spinach ;)). This one will definitely be on frequent rotation in our kitchen! Thank you!",
				"How are the \"tempering ingredients\" used in the dhal?",
				"Ania, Thank you, I am looking forward to making it.. tom",
				"HI Ania,You mentioned, regarding presoaking \"combining phytic acid rich foods with onion and garlic neutralizes its negative side-effects\". I am intolerant of onion and therefore don't use it. I can tolerate some garlic though. Would you suggest a little garlic in this dish is enough to counteract the negative effects or would a pre-soak be advised? I'm new to this so wasn't aware of negative effects!Thank you for your help and your recipes.Tracey"

				"Delicious recipe.  I subbed  the organic soy mince for vegan chorizo (No Evil Plant-Based Chorizo - El Zapatista brand) and used dried kidney and black beans instead of canned (I wish I used canned because I was impatiently cooking the chili for 6+ hours); the flavor was sensational and well worth the wait, though.  I paired this with cornbread and ate for a few days.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!",
				"Tried this recently using frozen soya mince and it was really good. Your blog is definitely my goto resource when catering for my  vegan daughter , she loves the meals and so do we. Looking forward to trying and enjoying many more, thank you.",
				"This chilli looks wonderful! Love that you paired it with some quinoa.",
				"This chili looks scrumptious. I put cilantro/coriander in everything else I make, but I have not put it in chili, so I will definitely do that. Rather than TVP, I use bulghur, which absorbs all the other flavors beautifully and adds the bulk and chewiness that non-vegans want in chili. No one ever knows it's not ground beef. Thank you for another wonderful recipe. And take good care of Tina!"

				"This is the first Lazy Cat recipe I've tried and it's as delicious as it looks! I was really happy that all the quantities were spot on, as it's often not the case, which is very frustrating and always makes me suspicious that the cook hasn't actually tested the recipe. I loved the combination of the roasted garlic with the celeriac and the mushroom bourguignon was outstanding - I say this as lover of the traditional beef version - and it has a real depth of flavour. Thank you!",
				"Absolutely delicious!!! And super easy. Perfect dish to make when it\u2019s starting to get cold",
				"This is amazing! Cooked it for my husband and I, but it\u2019s a worthy dinner party meal! Thank you for showing me what to do with celeriac!",
				"Hi Ania! Always love your recipes, planning on making this soon- I was just wondering, what does it mean to season the mash with the garlic head? Do you press the garlic and add it or do something else? Super looking forward to trying this!/Sarah",
				"i absolutely loved this recipe!! so rich and delicious, it felt like a real treat! id also never used miso paste or porcini mushrooms before either so this really gave me some new ideas!! love it, thank you!",
				"This is one of my favorite recipes so far. Thanks for sharing Ania :)",
				"Absolutely delicious!! I have made quite a few recipes from your website recently and have never been disappointed. This is definitely one of my favourites though. I didn\u2019t add wine and I used dried shiitake mushrooms as well as brown mushrooms and had it with polenta. Thank you for the great recipes!",
				"Ania thank you so much! This was amazing and I never thought the little balsamic at the end added such an incredible flavour. Absolutely delicious.",
				"I tried this recipe  a few weeks ago and it was delicious! The perfect combo! And as a big mushroom lover this is a BIG winner :)This week I will make it again for a festive dinner with 8 pers. Do I just need to multiply all the ingredients by 2? Thanks for all your inspiring recipes!",
				"I love this fine French stew. Followed the recipe and first time using celeriac.  A fancy vegan dish.  I have a photo but not seeing where to post.",
				"I bought celeriac at my farmer's market this afternoon with the intention of making a soup. Then I found this recipe and had to run to the store to get mushrooms. It came out absolutely delicious. The celeriac mash was fabulous . This will be my new potato mash substitute as the taste is subtle and did not overpower the tasty mushrooms and vegetables.",

				"This gorgeous dish is bubbling on my stove, very exited about! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"This looks delicious and I can't wait to try it, especially now that the days are getting cooler. I always keep some mushrooms on hand but will have to search out the dried porcini. BTW: fresh mushrooms will keep longer if you store them in a paper bag rather than plastic.",
				"This looks amazing and I am planning on making this week. I was wondering what I could use in place of miso Paste? I couldn't find it on my local store. Or could I just omit it without losing flavor?",
				"This looks completely epic!!! I have put the ingredients on my shopping list for next week, cant wait!! Thanks for the inspo xxx",
				"I'm not a huge Kale fan, would spinach work?",
				"Amazing recipe, Ania! I made smashed new potatoes instead of the mash but I want to do a mash next time.I eat a lot so I was worried about the portion size but this made some good-sized portions and I ended up getting five smaller meals out of it.Thanks for sharing :)",
				"I made this exactly as written. Normally I'm tempted to add more veggies and garlic, but I'm glad I didn't. It's perfect as is. For variations, I'm thinking I'll make this with mushrooms, parsnips, carrots, potatoes? Do you think that would work?Didn't have time to make the mash but will make it tomorrow and let you know :)Thank you again. We loved it!",
				"Amazing!!Did a few changes though -I didn\u2019t make the mash - just roasted halved potatoes in oil & balsamic vinegar.I didn\u2019t ad any celery.I didn\u2019t have any dried mushrooms so I simply sub water.I added white wine instead.I added soy sauce for color.Had dried spices instead of fresh.Only used one type of mushrooms.It was SO good. But not as pretty as yours, though. That didn\u2019t really matter anyways. I wasn\u2019t up for any photoshoots today  (;Your blog is one of the best I\u2019ve found (It\u2019s you & minimalist baker). All the recipes of yours that I have made have turned out awesome!! You rock!! (:",
				"My friend made it for me today and it was mind-blowing. Celeriac mash was too die for. Now my turn to make it, cheers for a great recipe!",
				"made this tonight and absolutely delicious! Even non vegan hubby loved it. Served with sweet potato and parsnip mash and had extra black cabbage with it!!",
				"Delicious!  Made this for dinner last night and hubby and I both loved it.  Quick and easy comfort food. I was out of tomato paste so I substituted a tablespoon of Harissa paste.  Gave it a wonderful, gentle  kick of heat that added to the comfort on this cold, snowy night so I think I will do it again even if I have tomato paste. I am new to your blog but loving it. Have tried several recipes and all a success.  Thanks!",
				"Another cracking recipe. Very very tasty.",
				"Hi Ania,I\u2019m new to cooking vegan and I did substitute the celeriac mash with root vegetable and homemade horseradish paste.This is such a tasty recipe! Even my husband liked this vegan meal!Thanks for posting it!",
				"Made this last evening for my vegan housemate \u2014 very successful and much enjoyed. Added to my new vegan repertoire. Many thanks.",
				"This was delicious! This was my first time cooking with celery root & I absolutely loved the pur\u00e9e. I thought that I had more carrots , but only had one so I subbed a parsnip. I portioned this out into 3 divided containers  after my dinnner. (I think they call this meal prepping \ud83d\ude09) I froze two and am taking one with me on my layover. As a flight attendant, having nutritious, vegan meals can be challenging when you\u2019re away from home. Thank you!!",
				"I made this tonight and it was delicious!  This was  my first time cooking with celery root and it is so grod-I roasted it along with the garlic . The only changes  I made was to add a turnip as I only had one carrot. I didn\u2019t add the kale because I forgot.  This will definitely be added into my  recipe roster!",
				"Look yummy :')",
				"This was perfect! This recipe was simple and  delicious. I couldn\u2019t find dried mushrooms to make the mushroom stock. So, I found mushroom stock at the grocery store and reduced 3 cups down to 1.5 cups  and it worked great in the recipe. I also couldn\u2019t find vegan bouillon but instead used a veggie stock concentrate block to get the extra flavor and salt and had no problems. Thanks for sharing it!",
				"This was simply amazing. Thank you so much!",
				"Where does the parsnip come in that I see in the photo? Or is that just decoration?!",
				"OMG This has to be the most amazing recipe I  have ever seen! And I absolutely live Celeriac (better known as Celery Root here in the States).  I will be trying these recipes very soon!! Thank You!!!"

I\u2019m soy free too so didn\u2019t use tofu but added poached chicken breast (sorry not vegan) and coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. Yum thanks for sharing!",
				"Incredible incredible versatile broth, wow!!!! Simple is best, as they say...",

				"Dear Ania,I am new to your site and have been a vegetarian most of my adult life, exploring world cuisine and LOTS of recipes.  May I say that your dishes are simply DIVINE!   I recently made the Ginger and Turmeric broth (and did add the coconut milk) as well as Tofu, red peppers, bok choy,  and organic baby corn.  My family was astounded at the flavor.  Even my 4 year old granddaughter LOVED it, saying, \" it is soooooo delicious.\"  My son settled on the words, \"absolutely delectable.\"     Next up, the \"pulled mushrooms!\"",
				"Yum! I love the combo of ginger and turmeric!",
				"Loved this recipe. It was a cold windy night and this was just perfect for warming us up. I added a spoon of red curry paste for a bit more body and a few cherry tomatoes. This will be a regular dish for sure. In fact I might make it again tonight!",
				"This recipe is delicious, and boy is it spicy.  I have to admit that I coughed after the first couple of bites, but I survived LOL  I loved the addition of coconut milk too.  I don't think that coconut milk in a recipe is ever a bad thing.   Thanks for the recipe.",
				"This looks and sounds divine! I can't wait to try it. Do you reckon it would freeze ok? Xx",
				"So glad I found your recipe! I made this last week and my boyfriend said it's the most delicious meal we've made at home - ever! I'm making it again tonight in a double batch for lunches all week :) x",
				"Hi! This looks amazing , I\u2019m making it for dinner in about an hour. I\u2019m just wondering what you did with the bok choy before adding it to your bowl? In the photo it looks a bit charred so I\u2019m assuming you threw it in a pan to soften it a little?  I\u2019ve never cooked with it before so I\u2019m not sure how to go about that part. Thank you :)",
				"Thank you, thank you, for this amazing recipe! I have made it twice now and I think about it all the time :) As others have commented, it is so healing and soothing. I could just drink a mug of the broth. After I make the broth, I blend it and strain it and it\u2019s so silky. Your recipes are fantastic as are your photos.  Thank you again!",
				"So excited to try this. My mouth is watering just looking at the picture. Looks amazing!!",

				"Hi Ania,How do you think this recipe would go with fresh turmeric? Would you just increase the amounts?Thanks so much!",

There's nothing raw in them that needs baking, and I don't think they need baking in shape when you could push the mash into a sausage shape before rolling. What do you think? It would save a fair bit of time. I haven't dried them yet but I'm thinking that I will for some vegan visitors next week.",

It\u2019s a great holiday centerpiece and non vegans will also enjoy it. Everyone was very impressed by the appearance with the braided puff pastry, too.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I did not make the balsamic reduction because I already had a thick balsamic straight from the bottle. I also added 2 tablespoons of the balsamic directly to the spinach filling after it was done cooking along with 1 tablespoon of tamari for a bit more umami flavor.  When assembling the Wellington, my puff pastry (Pepperidge farm) was small so I just pieced together 1 full sheet with another half sheet and rolled the whole thing out a little bit to make it big enough. Then followed the weaving instructions.  Overall it was easy to make with a big impact. I have made several of Ania\u2019s recipes and they all have been excellent so I highly recommend!",

Do I need more flour to get the long shape? 2. When I was cutting the log before the second bake, the log was crumbling. I did cool it but it wasn't completely cool and I did use a serrated knife. Any suggestions so the slices remain intact?",

I also used dried cranberries since I happened to already have some on hand. The texture is lovely and there is just a hint of sweetness with a nutty note. I thought of drizzling a bit of lemon glaze over them but then decided against it because I like the lightness of the biscotti as it is. I definitely recommend these little treats!",

Even better than what i have imagined ..I've made some changes: (and doubled the quantities after realizing the potential..)- mixed white and spelt flour (half-half)-Almond milk instead of soy, and added a bit more to make the dough more wet -after 15 minutes of the second bake, flip for another 5 minutes for beautiful Color and crunchiness..Thanks again for the brriliant recipe!",

After looking at so many recipes I came across yours. Sounded very similar to what he described.  I used version 2. I also made a few modifications. I used 20g brown sugar 45 g  fine granulated sugar  I roasted the almonds and omitted the cranberries 70g. Brushed the top with aquafaba and sprinkled with sugar. They came out amazing. I think on the second bake 5 min less.   He is very happy wish I could show you a pic. Thank you",

I had to add a fair bit of extra aquafaba but it wasn't a problem. You clearly state it in the recipe but for anyone guilty of having no patience, be sure to wait for the logs to cool before cutting them! Thanks for a great recipe, Ania!",

				"Hi, my sister and I loved these biscotti when they were non-vegan. Now having them vegan is an absolute delight! Unfortunately, we aren't able to have them where we live as it seems difficult to find for some reason... because they're not vegan either! Love this recipe - however, would using less sugar or any other sugar substitutes instead of caster sugar? And is it necessary to add the coconut oil? Thanks a lot!",
				"hi Ania thanks so much for so many beautiful recipes...I  bake vegan and gluten free and found the biscotti recipe fabulous...I used  basic gf plain flour and half a teaspoon of xanthum gum.....without the xanthum gum it works but is crumbly and difficult to cut....beautiful blessings.",
				"Hi, thank you for the recipe. I'm interested in trying these as a gift for my italian mother in law. Our family is vegetarian so I bake eggless. I have yet to come across a solid biscotti recipe so I would like to give these a go. Which version do you recommend I try first? The aquafaba or the milk version? Also, is caster sugar a must? I don't typically have that on hand. Can organic granulated sugar be used? Will it affect the texture? Thanks!",

I'm a fan of carrot cake, so I don't think I'd have any trouble trying to \"love\" the carrots inside these pancakes; and they smell like ginger cookies, you say?  SIGN ME UP. Definitely going to try this recipe out soon! And wow, how exciting about the move - I can relate to the bittersweet feeling though, as I've been moving around a lot the last few years too. Good luck preparing for it!",
				"These were wonderful! A big hit in our house and my 13 month old loved them. I added a few chopped pecans to the top of mine for additional texture. I was hoping there\u2019d be extra caramel sauce left over and I could just eat it with a spoon :).  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! We will be making this again. Good luck with your move!",
				"These look simply yummy--I'm all for anything that contains carrots and maple syrup. Wish you all the best in your move. It makes me a little sad to think of you and Duncan leaving your island paradise. Anglophile that I am, I've still been living vicariously through the two of you and love reading your descriptions of your life and activities in Greece as much as I love your recipes. But I'll keep up with your blog no matter where the two of you are. Safe and happy travels."

				"Hi Anya,- Cool.- OK, I might.- You should see these videos: https://youtu.be/OTRtR1cVl0c and https://youtu.be/IuYS-K5U_Xc. That's the brand I buy and it's available in the UK (https://lucybee.com/pages/stockists). I'm wary of saying that any brand is \"definitely cruelty free\", but...https://lucybee.com/blogs/all-blogs/are-monkeys-used-to-collect-coconuts-for-coconut-oilPETA lists it as one of the \"Brands That Don\u2019t Support Monkey Labour\" here:https://www.peta.org.uk/action/brands-drop-thai-coconut/Take a look at the label on their coconut oil:https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2133/6027/products/100ml5_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1603897068Given how clear they are on this issue, I think it could significantly damage the brand if they were caught using monkeys, so even from a purely selfish perspective it probably doesn't makes sense for them to do it.Regards,Nuno Dias",
				"- Have you tried making it with soy or oat milk? I try to have a package of almond milk around but I generally avoid using it.- Could the xanthan gum be substituted for corn starch? It's cheaper and already in my pantry.- I make coconut milk (when I occasionally need it for some recipe) from creamed coconut but I'm not sure that would work for this recipe, what do you think? Also, you might want to reconsider your link to Aroy-D's coconut milk (https://www.peta.org.uk/action/retailers-drop-thai-coconut/).",

				"This recipe looks yummy and I look forward to trying it! I am no good with desserts of baking, so a couple of questions - what size cake pan are you using for the sponge in order to get the desired thickness for the quantities you have? I too would like to try it as a cake rather than ramekins and trying to figure out quantities and pan sizes. You mentioned this amount serves in 4 ramekins and the 8inch square pan option by doubling only the ganache and cream - not the cake?Could you help clarify 1) how many servings this recipe makes (4, I am guessing) and what size pan you use for the sponge 2) would it work to double everything in the recipe and make a cake using a 9 inch round pan?",
				"I've tried the recipe a few times and it was delicious. One question, do you think the tiramisu can stand by itself like a cake after chilled in the fridge? For example, to make it in a cake tin and chill, would it firm up a bit so that it can stand on a cake stand instead of glass ramekins (I don't have pretty ones like yours)?   Thanks",
				"What can i use instead of Aquafaba? I dont really live next to a store so maybe it can be something i can make at home? Sorry if im being a little annoying ^-^. Oh and can i use cow cream instead of coconut cream? I searched vegan because i dont eat eggs, im very eager to try this recipe! :)Lola",

				"Hi Ania, is it possible to make it gluten free?",
				"This looks delicious!  I\u2019m thinking of making individual ones in shot glasses for a shower I\u2019m hosting.  I normally use coconut sugar in all my baking.  Woukd that work, or should I buy granulated sugar.  Also, woukd almond flour or whole wheat flour be okay?Thanks",
				"Hi,  this recipe  looks amazing. Just wondering, with the chocolate ganache layer, does it harden by the time you go to eat it, or is it soft and smooth. Given that this dessert needs to set in the fridge, I wanted to know if this will mean the chocolate layer becomes hard and difficult to cut through?",
				"Hi! I just made this and the flavours are fantastic! I will definitely make it again - it's an easy treat and everyone has loved it so far. However, it was actually impossible to get the coconut cream \"smooth with no lumps\" - I tried everything. Should it be at room temperature? I had mine straight from the fridge. So the top is essentially coconut cream bits held together by aquafaba. Any tips would be appreciated. It tastes great but the top \"cream\" layer is kind of weird.",
				"Your coffee amounts are confusing. The ingredients for the  chocolate coffee layer include half a cup whereas the method states a quarter of a cup. Is the spare quarter of a cup to be used to soak the sponge?",
				"Looks great. I'm curious if you can make this ahead of time? Does the cream layer \"flatten\" easily, since it is made with aquafaba?Ideally I would like to make this day before, if it can hold up.Thanks",
				"Hi Ania!Thank you so much for your wonderful-sounding and looking recipes!  I'm excited to try some of them.  I have a question on the Tiramisu - I noticed that the cream layer is made up mostly of coconut cream and I'm wondering if you taste a lot of the coconut taste - or does the chocolate layer counteract it enough?  I'm not a big coconut fan.Also wanted to mention that often in the U.S., tiramisu is made with Kahlua (a coffee-flavored sweet liquor) along with the strong coffee.  Thanks for your help",
				"Yumm this is a very creamy and tasty recipe. I may have to make extra spongecake next time just to enjoy by itself it's so good!One tip for making: Clean your whisk between whisking the coconut cream and the aquafaba. I didn't the first time and my aquafaba wouldn't inflate, I think due to the coconut oils on the whisk!",

				"I just made these muffins, and used half a cup of raw sugar, and I used almond meal, because I am too lazy to make my own almond milk (I buy it), so no almond pulp, but that doesn't matter.... The secret to moist cakes and muffins is to add a teaspoon of vegetable glycerin to the batter, a French pastry chef gave this tip to my Mother many years a go and it works. I made my muffins in the 'Texas' size as smaller one reminds me of cupcakes, they still turned out extremely well however they did require more baking time",
				"I was  looking for some way to use the pulp from juicing carrots, apple and ginger when I found  this amazing recipe.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to do some substitutions.....and as it is with incredible recipes....it came out beautifully! I didn't have oat flour, so I used all purpose white flour. I used Ener-G egg replacer, used only pumpkin and sunflower seeds on the top.....and added 1/2 cup of each into the batter as well.....I also baked some of the batter in doughnut pan and baked for 20 minutes. These are a huge hit at home, as breakfast, a grab and go or just as a snack....so much so that I gave some to a friend who called this morning saying \"OMG! OMG!\" and asked for the recipe. I love this recipe......and love that its flexible in the ingredients and still wonderful!!  Kudos!! It's amazing!!!",

I didn't pay attention to the lower quantity needed if using ground almonds so added an extra splash of soya milk at the end. I also didn't have enough walnuts so used half walnuts and half raisins.

I've cooked it for fellow vegans and meateaters much to their delight!  I've shared the recipe too many a new vegan too.I wouldn't change a thing although I will add I crisped my up in the airfryer rather than the oven which works wonderfully. Keep on sharing please I love your recipes!",

I do have a bit of trouble steaming my pancakes in the bamboo steamer (from Frozen), they often stick together and I end up wasting a few. Do you have any tips or tricks? Thanks!",

I'd tried the \"pulled pork\" style and it got me thinking about using it in other shredded style dishes. Enter Google and here you are!  My newly converted bf loves it too. Better than the real thing! Thanks for sharing.",
				"oh my goodness these are amazing.  My vegan dinner guests are still talking about it!",
				"Made this today and enjoyed it for dinner. Different flavor profile than I normal go for and I appreciated the change, ate it on a tortilla instead of making pancakes. The only thing I'd do different next time is reduce the soy sauce, even with low sodium soy sauce I found it a bit salty for my taste, but no worries, I'll just tweak it next time, there'll definitely be a next time. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!",
				"This recipe is soooo yummy!  Have made a few of your recipes now and they are all A+++. Thanks for the unique takes on some of my old favourites. I made my own pancakes too as I live in a tiny village in Bavaria where the local tastes are rather mild and the shops are quite limited. Will definitely be making these again very soon.",
				"Hi,Just discovered your site and have been enjoying it.  Thank you.  A couple of questions about this recipe.  What size tins for the jackfruit? Also, would I have to go to Chinatown to get the pancakes (I live in Montreal) or do most Asian supermarkets carry them?  Could soft flour tortillas be substituted? Thanks!",
				"Hi Ania,I doubled the recipe and to the Jackfruit \"Duck\" I added 2 chopped serrano peppers for heat.  I also added a handful of Thai basil leaves during the last five minutes of cooking.  I  served it with green onions, sesame seeds and chopped cilantro leaves sprinkled on top and  accompanied by cooked Jasmine rice.  It was delicious!!  I had two friends over for dinner and they loved it too.  Next time, I will try it with the pancakes.  Thank you again for this awesome recipe.",

Thank you so much Ania  for this recipe  _()_    I for sure will make it soon!  greetings from Denver Magdalena",
				"Hi Ania,Such an ingenious recipe!  It will be a great substitute for one of my favorite Thai dishes.  At a local Thai restaurant I order Tofu Duck Basil - it looks like after pressing the tofu, it is cooked in Thai basil sauce, then it is fleshed out and so it looks like duck meat.   It is delicious.  I have not been able to find any details about how to make tofu have theconsistency and appearance of duck meat .  Thank you for this recipe.

I make my lasagna with canned tomatoes and usually use less cans than the recipe suggests (3-4) and it turns out perfect.  The bechamel sauce is way better than any other vegan lasagna sauce  I have ever tried (and I tried many). Thank you, Ania for sharing this and other delicious  recipes with us. \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019m a big fan.",

				"This was an absolute dream of a lasagna.I didn't use aubergines, not because I'm one of those weirdos who don't like them, but because I wanted the dish to be totally distinct from your lovely moussaka. I also added lentils, as suggested ,and a layer of spinach, which I've always liked in a lasagna. I used your moussaka (\"Mr Cauliflower\") bechamel because my wife is allergic to the cashew nuts in the topping you outline here. My one gripe is aesthetic - the bechamel cracked up quite a lot and separated in a sort of continental drift effect. Do you know what might cause that?  I suspect I got the portions of oil/cauli/soya milk wrong (btw, I can't use the recommended almond milk due to the allergy issue; and I didn't use the optional  nutritional yeast). Having botched a few in my time, I always get a bit stressed  when I make a bechamel - and have usually had too much wine by that stage of preparation - so I'm not sure whether I followed the directions properly. Any thoughts? I'll give the recipe a 5 if I can sort this out. Cheers - David",

I have to admit that I ate two portions because I couldn't stop. ; )Okay, it really takes some time to prepare everything, but I promise it is worth it.I made my last Lasagna when I was still vegetarian & thought without cheese I will not try it again in a vegan version. And I was never a big fan of Bechamel, but this great cashew based Bechamel is so tasty on top. This is definitely a great dish when you have guests.Thanks for this new recipe, Ania! I will post pictures on instagram.",

I just don't have any tapioca starch at home, and I wouldn't really know what to use it for except for this great recipe....do you think I could replace it with psyllium husk powder, as it is also used to thicken sauces etc.?

Thank you for sharing all of your recipes.",

				"Just coming back here to report that I made it with chia egg and it turned out fantastic! I swapped the aquafaba with 15 grams chia and 75 grams water, let it soak for a bit, and then blended them until it became an almost-smooth eggy looking past. I was worried it will give the creme a grey-ish tone but after backing I could barely see any difference. I\u2019m really happy it worked cause while the results  using aquafaba are great, chia is more accessible. So it\u2019s nice to have that option",

				"Thank you for taking the time to reply :) I thought I'd share my pie making experience- I didn't have xanthan gum or coconut oil (oops) so I used chia seeds and vegan butter in the pastry. I also used fresh cherries instead of the figs. I think I cooked it for a little too long but it's really delicious and the pastry (although a bit overcooked) is lovely! I'm so excited as it was my first time making pastry, gluten free or otherwise. I served it with coconut yoghurt and it was thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks for the awesome recipe!",
				"I am trying to make this tart and I notice that the orange zest and the almond essence are not mentioned in the instructions.  I just threw them in the filling mix at the end and I'm hoping for the best.  Also, my filling came out more like wet sand than batter.  Is this how it is supposed to be, or is there some other liquid that should be added?  Thank you.",
				"I did cream the oil and sugar using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment until it was thick and creamy and homogeneous.  It just seemed that 1/3 cup of olive oil and 3/8 cup of aquafaba did not provide enough moisture for the 2 1/2 cups of almond meal.  I did taste it prior to baking and it was delicious, but after baking, it looks like it has the consistency of the crumb top of a coffee cake. I did not want to cut into it because I'm saving it for Thanksgiving.  I'm sure it will taste wonderful and the texture will not be bad, just not like what was in your pictures, so I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.

Your recipe seems like just what I'm looking for. However, I have one concern that you might be able to help with. Puff pastry cooks very quickly and given that the frangipane will be encased in it there is no real option to slow down the baking of the pastry as the frangipane cooks. As such, I am fearful of the only thing as bad as vegan butter: raw flour. Do you have any suggestions that might save me from my predicament and bring almond tarts back into my life?Thanks in advance.",

				"Hi Ania! Just made this cake (GF version) and the texture and flavor of the cake is on point! Fluffy, moist, delicious, just wonderful. I made two slight variations and I have a question for you. The first is that I put about a 1/2 tsp salt as I have a preference for baked goods, esp cake, to have some salt. The second variation I made was to add a tiny pinch of cardamom powder, as this spice accentuates the fruitiness in a recipe ( Froot Loops purportedly contained this spice as a secret ingredient.) My question for you: How do you keep the plums from sinking? I dusted the side of the plums that touched the batter with cornstarch, but they still sunk. Seems that this is a finicky art to nail, since that's why you made this cake so many times. If you would share any tricks you learned in the process this would be so appreciated. The beauty of this cake is the plums on top, like your pictures, and I hope for some insight into how to achieve this \"work of art\" look!",

I did replace a little bit of buckwheat flour (because it was the first time ever I was going to eat it) for whole wheat flour that I regularly use in baking (organic, ultra-fine, lovely brand). It went 3/4 cup of almond meal, 1/2 cup buckwheat and 1 cup of whole wheat to the batter.  We loved the texture of the cake! I believe I will be trying the regular version soon and maybe do some other experiment not vegan (so I can discard the baking soda idea) with the buckwheat.  They say so many marvelous things about the buckwheat that I really hope it is not that I just do not like it ;)All the best,Silvana",

When potatoes are cut in pieces, they cook very fast (about 10 minutes). So it's quite a simple and easy lunch to prepare. The layering in a jar first resulted out of necessity as I didnt have any plastic Tupperware around. But I love the look of the layers in a jar!

I confirmed with one barista that it is skim milk, but he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just any skim milk.\u201d Unfortunately, he moved on from there back to his busy line of coffee drinkers waiting for their orders. Is there a special Greek skim milk? I\u2019m hoping, like you, that I can use the blenders/mixers/frothers I already have to at least get close to what I enjoyed so much in Greece (Mytilene).",

Iced coffee is my drink of choice in the summer months, but I drink it plain or with a dash of coconut milk if I need a little more \"body\" to the drink. But I don't need to drink it plain anymore.

I  didn\u2019t have any mint so used  dry oregano and flat parsley and it worked well too. Was not sure whether to use cooked or uncooked rice  but as I had  underdone rice in  stuffed peppers served in restaurants  on few occasions I decided to cook my cook my rice  and cool it down before mixing  with the other ingredients.

The pineapple or pear makes the banana sweeter and creamier without being overpowering. Electric is easiest but hand cranked also works.",

Aside from the taste (which I'm okay with) do you think this would work in the recipe as there are bits of chia seeds which cause it to not be totally smooth? Is the smoothness of the butter a texture thing for the pudding, or will it not turn out fluffy due to the bits? I have almonds and a Vitamix, so I could make my own almond butter, but I've never done that before and would rather use what I have. Also, because the seed and nut butter is natural, it's pretty oily. Will that deflate my peaks or is this oil act differently from grease? Sorry for all the questions. I can't wait to make this!!!!

You convinced me to make my own hazelnut butter though - it will even be cheaper than buying. My food processer is a cheapo one from Lidl but it will get the job done. Btw I made the chocolate mousse this morning but it doesn't have the nice air pockets yours does. I think that I may not have whipped the AF long enough or I should have reduced the AF more (I freeze it in an ice cube tray and sometimes don't know what type it is ;)) but the texture is very creamy and lovely so far (it's been chilling for 3 hrs so far) so I'm looking forward to having it in the evening :)Ps: I entered you in the contest yesterday - good luck!",

I think you may have a typo, or at least poorly worded  instruction.Do you mean to say to add only the chilled part /congealed fat of  a full tin (already 14 ounces) of coconut milk or coconut cream and to discard the  liquids...so in fact you are only adding 3-4 ounces not the entire contents of the can (or 1.5 cups as the instructions say?)   SInce I was using room temperature coconut cream, I thought I needed to add 1.5 cups.  So my cream is very soupy this morning despite following the instructions with stiff peaks, sugar and xanthum gun.  I suspect now , fer searching the internet for other recipes, I was only supposed to add the congealed fat, as I see some other recipes online make that distinction.

I'm not used to tzatziki being so thick but that's an easy adjustment if it ends up being necessary to thin it out.

I got mango pickles from an Asian market nearby and finally got a chance to use them. The condiments are fantastic. Worth the work.",

I love hot spices and made a much simpler recipe one summer. - basically green chilis, parsley and garlic with an oil and lemon dressing  - heavy on the chilis. Good in small portions as a relish. I was working as in an engineer in a factory;  when talking to one of the factory workers we found that we both loved hot food. I brought him a small jar of zhoug and he shared it with friends at work.  They did like it but they decided that I must have a cast iron  mouth , throat and stomach. :DBeing men, they didn't sample it delicately but shoveled it into their mouths.",

I didn't have any mango chutney so used some fresh mango mixed with some lime pickle which worked well. This was a hit in a sandwich loving household. Thanks",

I did homemade pittas, just equal quantities of self raising flour and yoghurt, plus a little oregano. Then rolled out and cooked in a flat pan. Wasn\u2019t sure whether it was worth doing all the extras, but adds so much flavour.Thanks for the blog!",

I didn't feel like spending too much time bent over the stove and was looking for something that had a few fun elements that I could just put together. We don't get amba here, I didn't have parsley so subbed for fresh coriander, and I couldn't find pitas at the local grocer's but got piadinas instead, and, still, it was a stellar meal. We ended with sorbet, chilled wine and fruit. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much for sharing.",

One of my sister's in law is Syrian, one Iranian, another is Iraqi , and my my mother-in-law is Egyptian and so the meals at their houses are spectacular. All the semiotic peoples of the region have lived there for thousands of years and no one has claim over a chopped cucumber salad. Calling it Israeli is just fine.   Food should unite.",

I admit I've skipped the step of leaving the preparartion in the fridge overnight, no smoked liquid, avocado instead of pickled onignions and honey instead marple syrup.

Today I tried it with liquid smoke for the first time and I think two teaspoons full is just far too much. How has everyone else gone with this much liquid smoke added? I think I will  stick to just smoked paprika from now on. Cheers for the delicious recipes."

Other recipes were full of huge superfluous amounts of oil, or were not as flavorful (love how the simmer of the tomato sauce brings out the best of the jammy tomato and onion), and yours was the first I found that added cinnamon. So very delicious! Thank you.",

I soaked them overnight in a covered pot, then dumped that water, rinsed the benas, put fresh water to cover them by a couple of inches, and simmered them for a full HOUR.  They were somewhat crunchy, but I figured maybe that was what you meant by \u201cal dente\u201d, so I proceeded as the recipe directed.  After the first hour in the oven, uncovered, I added hot water and covered them, hoping that would help.  There was a slight improvement, so I have done that now for a total of four additional cups, gping on the third hour, covered.  The water is being absorbed even with the lid on... I keep checking and that is why I add more.   I am uisng a Le Creuset dutch oven at 355F.  Thoughts?  It smells really good...Thanks!",

By the afternoon you have the smell of spices and baked treats permeating your home. Still fresh days later, if they last that long. Would recommend and super easy for beginners.",

I don\u2019t have any bread flour and can\u2019t get any at this time because all the stores are out of it. Can I use 4 cups all purpose for the whole recipe?  Would they still turn out? Thanks!!

My only changes were to use whole wheat flour, date sugar, and rapid rise yeast (because I'm impatient/ don't plan ahead), and to add 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and cloves. I did have to add a bit more liquid, presumably due to the date sugar.",
				"Being a new transplant to the UK, hotcross buns was a new food item to me. To my Brit husband, step son and extended family, this was a beloved treat. As such, I just had to find a vegan recipe that would appeal to these bun lovers. This recipe did it! Easy to follow and produce, two things I love, but all useless without...taste. The boys loved them as did other hotcross bun lovers in my little village. A perfect amount of sweet, but  not overly so, fluffy, and oh so gloriously pretty and presentable once glazed. I highly recommend this recipe.",
				"Great recipe! I made a couple changes: orange juice in place of orange zest, and omitted the oil to make them fat free. I would also suggest to anyone making this (especially if the flour is measured by cup instead of weight) that you do not put in all the flour at the beginning. Leave one cup to add gradually while kneading, as it turned out I did not need the last 1/2 cup at all. A friend who tried the recipe as written had a more dry result. I will make these again!",

Is there a maximum time we should allow for proving? i.e. could I leave the dough to rise in the fridge or on the counter overnight, and then bake them in the morning? If so, would you recommend fridge or counter? Hoping to make these for Good Friday. Thanks in advance!",

I was wondering what is blooming on the hillsides in Greece right now and your little bouquet answered a few questions.  The mallow is just charming. There is a wonderful  soup that the beduin used to feed us made  from fresh foraged mallow leaves and dried goat cheese. Enjoy your Easter  -Hanne"

Second time I used one huge sweet potato  weighing exactly 600gr plus I only added 4 table spoons of chickpea flour (not 6) and the texture of the burger was great. I ended up with 6 good size burger patties. I was a bit more generous with the seasoning this time and they were absolutely perfect; firm and crispy on the outside with a wonderful flavour. My whole family enjoyed the burgers and they are not vegan.They take a bit of time to make, but you could perhaps make your sweet potatoes in the microwave instead ( it only takes few minutes ) if you wanted to save some time ;).Thank you very much for the great recipe, certainly the best vegan burgers I made so far :)",

It doesn't say  how many millilitres they are, but a tablespoon is quite big.  I checked the description of few measuring spoons that E-bay sells at the moment and they are always either 15ml or 20ml. I can't measure mine accurately, but it looks like it's a 20ml spoon. I guess his would explain why I only needed 4 tbsp. I will keep it in mind next time :)",

				"Yum. I'm not usually motivated to cook a big breakfast, but this is one dish that I loooove to eat in the morning. I've made your shakshuka about five times now  and it's a family favorite. I add in an extra block of tofu. My kids and I eat it generously scooped over toast. Thanks for sharing it with us.",
				"This was so delicious!! I made it after a hard day at work and it made me feel so much better!",

Now i'm going along for dinner your site is great.  I use lemon zest instead of orange as i prefer the flavour and alternate the almond with chia or flaxseed ground up for adding omega 3,6 and 9 to the diet.",
				"Great minds think alike - I've been craving menemen (kind of similar to shakshuka - it is based on tomatoes, green peppers and chili - and eggs) last weekend and have successfully veganised it by using the VeganEgg and a bit of kala namak - I've made it three times since! Your version looks delicious too! I'll give tofu another go, it hasn't convinced me as a scrambled egg substitute so far.",
				"So I gave soft tofu a try (I don't have silken tofu at the moment) and it blended with the dish/ flavours beautifully and I have to admit that I've been making some variety of a tomato-based egg dish since! Next time I go shopping I'll get plenty of silken tofu. I think the reason why I wasn't convinced before is because I used hard tofu just like other scrambled eggs recipes suggested and you could still clearly taste the tofu (which I don't actually mind, but it wasn't desired) -  but when I made \u017curek a few months ago I used cubed silken tofu as 'eggs' to float around in the pot and the texture was amazingly realistic! Shame it didn't spark an idea in my brain then ;)So many thanks for suggesting silken tofu! That opened up a door of menemens, shakshukas, leek-tomato mixes etc, that has been shut for so long :)As for the VeganEgg - I probably won't buy it again any time soon as it is very expensive (\u00a37 - \u00a38) and the texture is very spongy and... 80% like scrambled eggs. It's fun to see it scramble, the flavour is egg-like but it's just not convincing which is why I decided to give it a go with menemen and it worked pretty well. Also, it doesn't fill you up for too long. So if I can get a very similar result with silken tofu then it's no question! :)",
				"Hi Ania - I'm not vegan or even vegetarian, but trying to eat more plant based foods as my body loves me back when I do. I found you via your Choc mousse - mainly my curiosity for making my own aquafaba - and I've been drooling over your other recipes. Beautifully put together and photographed - I will definitely be adding some to our weekly menu plans.",
				"This looks heavenly. I tried this dish once but I wasn't thrilled with the \"egginess\" of it. Using tofu is a stroke of genius (and I can skip the black salt as I don't need the egg flavor). You always help me get the spices just right, and this combination looks perfect. Thank you, as always!!"

And for measuring in metric xDI just did and it worked out all right (using plain all-purpose flour), even tho I didn't really let it proof for the second time (I forgot to set a timer on the first fermentation and ran out of it to make lunch hahaha). I also kneaded it in a mixer (bread hook on), 10/10 recommend. Oooo and in order to roll the dough nice and evenly, I placed two bamboo pickers (the long ones used in bbq) and rolled the pin until reaching those :) Well, as for the filling I couldn't really  get to the essencen of the spices due to the lack of them on any asian store nearby - so I ordered it online from another state.

The jackfruit recipe was great- I didn't have Chinese 5 spice but ground up the spices for it except star anise, which I did not have. The instructions for steaming the buns was clear and great- they turned out perfectly. Definitely a fun meal! I ended up using some general tso's sauce that I had to put on top to make this a bit saucier. I topped the jackfruit with ribboned carrots, sliced cucumbers, purple cabbage, and crushed peanuts. I would definitely make this again!",

It didn't go grainy, but the oil (presumably from the coconut milk) separated from the chocolate. I tried two batches, and it happened with both. I didn't have any more chocolate so I drained off the oil from the second batch and used it as it was. It seemed to work OK, just not sure why this happened!",

I haul sugar cane during the harvest and can guarantee that a lot of animals including wild dogs, pigs and native animals end up in the bin with the cut cane... Food for thought.... Good recipe by the way...",
				"Great recipe and super flexible. I used some left over untoasted muesli I bought for a guest, replacing the oats and coconut and they worked out fine. I did have to add a little extra flour because the muesli was quite dense and didn\u2019t soak up as much liquid. I then discovered a pack of coconut hiding up the back of the cupboard and so made the recipe as written and that also worked well - although the different batches have slightly different textures as you\u2019d expect. Now the only problem is what to do with all these biscuits!",
				"Just made the Anzac biscuits which are now my favorite cookie.  I did not have coconut, so I used an equal amount of almond flour.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, using the maple syrup choice. Easy to make!  Beware of eating all of the dough raw (tasty!). The cookies are just the right crunch - not too hard and not too delicate.  Sweet enough but not overly sweet.  Yum, yum, yum - thank you for another wonderful  vegan recipe, Ania.",

				"Ohhh goodness!!  Absolutely delicious! After reading all the fantastic reviews I decided to half the recipe because I knew the possibility of eating too many would be my reality!  I used brown sugar and quick oats as that\u2019s what was in the cupboard and they turned out amazing! Thanks for the recipe, will definitely be making and sharing this one many times.",

				"These are so delicious! Currently living abroad and these were the perfect cure for my home sickness! Gave a batch to some Aussie neighbours and they were a hit!",

				"Yum! I just made these using coconut oil and golden syrup. The two didn\u2019t come together in the saucepan but I added it anyway and  was fine once stirred through the dry ingredients. Would make again!",
				"Made these today on ANZAC day, it\u2019s warm here about 28 deg Celsius so I needed a tiny amount water  as suggested. Turned out great, we melted some vegan chocolate  over the top and bam \ud83d\udca5 delicious",
				"Unfortunately my batch were really crumbly and wouldn\u2019t shape into balls either, but pliers on with half the batch then decided to add an egg to the other half as mix wasn\u2019t binding. Defeats the purpose of vegan cookies I guess but didn\u2019t see the suggestion for adding extra hot water to mix until it was too late, maybe add that note into the recipe as I see looking at the comments a lot of people have had the same outcome.",
				"I made these and the dough was falling apart and hard to shape. I figured it might have been because I used large flake oats. I see in the comments now that you wrote that adding hot water might have been helpful to bind them. When baked they were very crumbly but more or less kept their shape - and were very delicious!",
				"Made these a second time. So delicious. Thank you!",

				"Hullo With a friend coming over who loves a good munch I had a quick trawl for a quick biscuit recipe.. she's not vegan but trying to be more plant based...many suggestions inc: how not to die has seen many changes in her lifestyle and I am encouraging her with my vegan food/plant based diet.So using what I had at home I have to tell you how amazing these worked out.  I only had spelt flour and my baking soda was dead, so I added baking powder. I also had a mix of vegan Marg and coconut butter...it all worked...I also added 70g of muesli, which I blitzed in a food processor and 15g of spelt to make up for the desiccated coconut ...only other adjustment was 2 extra tablespoons of hot water as the spelt flour need more moisture to enable the dough to be doughy!!!So I really messed with your recipe and guess what they were still brilliant and that is priceless, sometimes I find that internet recipes can be hit and miss ... I was also worried as your recipe says 100g = 1 cup!! So i  ignored the cups and stayed with the 100grams as a cup I think is normally 240grams... Ho HUMThank you again for a great biscuit recipe that worked even tho I tweaked it a awful lot!!!",
				"Hey just wondering what the extra tbsp of caster sugar and Flour are for...as I see it in the ingredient list but it doesn't get mentioned at all in the recipe.",
				"I just made it with coconut oil but it was really crumbly. I measured everything in grams. I added more oil, about 60 g extra, because I couldn\u2019t roll a ball of this original mixture. I baked it in 180 degrees and it was done in 10 minutes. It turned out greasy and crumbled a lot. The taste is goed though.",
				"Made them today and they are the best vegan cookies I've ever tried! As I had some mixture of grinded hazelnuts, I put these instead of coconut and they are amazing.. looking forward though to try also with coconut. Thank you very much for this delightful variation of anzac \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude18",
				"Made lovely cookies but despite following recipe closely the mix was too dry to shape into balls so I added coconut milk. I used solid raw coconut oil not refined - would that be why it was too dry? Everyone enjoyed them and they have only lasted one evening! Highly recommend this delicious and easy recipe to all. :) Also wondered what adding sultanas would be like...",
				"Hi, the recipe looks great, actually tasted awesome in the cooking bowl before I added the baking soda, I tried it after cooking, unfortunately the batch had to be thrown out, the baking soda was really bitter, too overpowering. I believe this recipe you are using is half of the standard dry ingredients, so maybe for this amount of ingredients, it needs to be adjusted to half a teaspoon of baking soda?  I just went to another recipe site and pulled up their ingredients, and its double the dry ingredients to 1 tsp of baking soda.  Just thought id add this comment in here, incase others have a similar experience, maybe best to halve the baking soda for this recipe.Excellent vegan recipe's though,  I would love to try some of your dinners, they look amazing.Jesus bless you :-)))",
				"These Anzacs are amazing! So crunchy and delicious! Best vegan biscuit I've made. Thank you Duncan",
				"For me the cookies came out tasting too strong of baking soda. Next time I might halve the amount. But overall still good!",
				"These turned out so well! I made them gluten free by using GF oats and subbing 1 cup store bought GF blend plus  2 tbsp almond flour. Yummy!",
				"These look so good! I recently made some oaty vegan cookies this past weekend, that i'll soon share on my blog but I LOVE the idea of adding coconut. Can't wait to try! xx ",

Also the rosemary beetroot on it\u2019s own is something I\u2019ll likely cook again.

I forget to use the nutritional yeast and, though  I taasted the walnuts, I forgot to put them in the spinach also. That crunch element was missed in the dish. I also didn't have black salt or poppy seeds so I just sprinkled black pepper over it and it looked fine. But when I make it again this is what I will do. I will use less mushrooms and more  spinach. (I had leftover mushroom-mixture  after stacking it on the beets.) I will role out the dough to be wider to easily cover the log. I think I will slice up the beets rather than leave them whole. It was hard to cut the log without making a mess of it. I think if you slice the beets and use the skewer to hold them together it will work better. Also, I was thinking it may be interesting to use vegan sausages instead of the beets for an entirely different take. Or  maybe make a loaf out of the  delicious \"Beyond Meat\" hamburgers and cover that with the spinach and mushroom mixture.  But then the impact of that beautiful red beet will be lost. Maybe wrapping  smaller beets in the \"meat\" loaf will do it---or--- am I getting crazy here.",
				"This is stunning.  I'm making it for Christmas but am a little confused (and nervous) about how to wrap it right.  Pepperige farm PP sheets are 10x15\", so I want to fill 4x10.  In order to have seams on the short ends  I would need to run the 4x10 square right up to the edges.  Any advise would be very much apprecated.  Thanks for this incrediblely beautiful masterpiece.  Just brilliant!",
				"Thank you, Ania.  How kind of you to reply so quickly.  I've created a diagram and am feeling much better about it.  Unless it's a complete failure, I'll upload photos.  I just can't even believe I get to make this!!! Thanks again and Happy Holidays!Kate",
				"Hey :) Is it possible to cut the beets and Mix with the other stuff?",
				"Hi Ania, this looks great! Unfortunately my boyfriend can't stand mushrooms. Can you suggest any alternatives for this recipe? Thanks! Lesley",
				"Thanks, Ania, really like your suggested alternatives!",
				"is it \u00bc cup nutritional yeast absolutely necessary? How can I replace it?",

				"I made this today and it came out AMAZING! I\u2019ve recently been experimenting with vegan recipes, have been vegetarian my whole life but trying to be vegan a few days a week . I used golden syrup instead as it\u2019s all I had and it was delicious. The aquafaba was new to me but worked well. I halved the recipe but now wish I made more!! When I heated the oil after I took it off the heat, I added the sugar then a stick of cinnamon, some fresh cloves and cardomam as well. Let it infused then removed it. Also I put nutmeg too Will definitely be using again - thanks for posting :)",

				"Hey Ania! Love your version of gingerbread cookies, and there is nothing wrong with your icing skills! They look awesome! Also, congratulations to your parents for coming up with the idea of plasticine to keep you guys occupied! My parents used to give me and my brothers packs of 'wycinanki'  and got us to make all the paper chains for xmas tree , then whoever made the longest one, won (there were no prizes, as you said, communist/ post communist Poland  sucked! :)  pinning these bad boys for later! x",
				"What are you talking about, your icing skills are great!! I just love the way you've decorated these cookies - they are sooooo cute! Especially the little kisses and love hearts. Great idea!",
				"Hi Ania,I started to follow you not so long ago, but already developed a habit of checking your website every single day ;) It is addictive!Your recipes are amazing and the pictures look fantastic (mouth-watering ;) )!!  I look forward to trying these cookies. They are so Christmasty.Please keep up your work!! Love.Ps: I love your cats <3"

A painfully slow way to make fried potatoes, but very good! Deep frying would be easier. The baking seems necessary to make the spices blend? I also added some powdered garlic to the potatoes. The dipping sauce is worth making as well. When you soak cashews all night, the juice is a very tasty nut milk. I'll definitely be making this again. Thank you!",

He will how ever eat sweet potatoes once in awhile, so I was thinking of making these with sweet potatoes instead of regular ones.  Have you tried that? Let me know.Wendy",

I, too, faced a similar situation a few months ago--minus the speeding car and the fleas. I found a half-starved, tiny kitten in the road, trying to catch a bug.

I've had her two months now, and I  hate to tell you this, Ania, but now that she's a little bigger, the boys don't run anymore, and she wraps her little paws around one as they sleep together. Granted, female cats are notorious for not accepting new females into their domain, but once the little one is healthy and growing, Tina might find she likes having a companion. Just saying  . . .  In the meantime, she is a very luck y girl that you two found her and are caring for her.",
				"Ania you are encouraging my obsession with squash and pumpkin. The photos on this one are particularly  enticing with the repeating points of earthy orange,  fiery red and brilliant green.  Why don't you contact HydraArk about the new kitten. They are super friendly and helpful. If you make up a little  bio for the kitten replete with photos many of us would share it on Facebook  .-Johanne",
				"Love this recipe! Will try it soon :) About the kitty, I cannot say enough how happy I ham that you found her and are taking care of her - she is very lucky! I had  a simillar situation a few months ago and I was very fortunate to have found my street kitties a forever home where they are being treated with love! I hope you find a home for your foster kitty soon*"

				"Many thanks for the amazing recipe! I have made it several times already with different nuts too (walnuts and peanuts)I buckwheat flour is not available where I live so I use oat flour, I divided the dough into 24 cookies instead of 16 (because more cookies, right?), the result was incredible crispy cookies instead of soft, which is how I actually prefer my cookies :)The first time to make it I felt it was not sweet enough for me, so the following times I eliminated the cocoa powder and increased the amount of flour a bit, it was a huge hit in my house. I plan on experimenting a bit more and try using date paste for sweetening as well.Love it!Yasmeen",

				"Hi, When I read the recipe, I wondered that there is no fat, other than the one in tahini and the nuts, and when I read the message of Sita, I remembeted some experiences of my own, when cookies or other biscuits tasted dry, and they where without fat too, so I always thought that was the reason. I\u2019d like to try those adding some vegetable oil or so. What do you think? Thanks for uour answer. Can\u2019t rate as I dis not yet try it out.",

Turned out great ( soft as promised) even though I had only tahini and raw cocoa at hand and had to substitute all the rest:  I used honey instead of maple syrup, ground almonds and oat flour.

				"hello! I made this today :-) I wasn't familiar with fava before, so just followed your recipe to the letter. Mine came out much stodgier than yours looks - yours looks so fine and creamy! I added lots of olive oil, and even some cold water to get it to a dip consistency, but it was still dollop-able. But very tasty! Do you think it's just the high speed blender that gets it so creamy? I made mine in a regular food processor. Mine was also much paler - like beige coloured. I added some turmeric to pep it up a bit colour wise. We all enjoyed it though, especially with the onions and capers on top. Thanks for the recipe :-)",
				"I didn't know fava before your post but it really looks delicious. I love Greek food, it's always great :)",
				"Fava is one of those Greek recipes that found it's way to my kitchen too and never left. I put my own tweak on it of course, as I always do. Never ask me to follow a recipe exactly :DI fry onion, garlic and grated carrot first in the pot. Then add water , salt and fava, let it boil until it's very soft and then I don't blender it because my family likes it like that (in the North a very similar dish is done with pork and eaten around Easter, maybe you have it Poland too). In the very end I add fresh dill and parsley. So the idea started with fava and ended up being something completely different :D My Greek man who doesn't like the traditional fava, loves my creation. ;)"

				"These look like an awesome treat, I absolutely love dates in baked goods. While they aren't actually sugar-free (they contain quite a lot of natural sugars, so this recipe wouldn't be great for diabetics), they're not refined sugar. I'm sure they would make a nice, sticky filling for cinnamon rolls! And congratulations on your successful procedure! Not being able to drink coffee would be torture. I saw in a comment from two years ago that you hadn't tried any alternative flours. Has that changed? If not I totally understand! I've switched to a mostly wheat-free lifestyle due to stomach issues, and while dairy and other substitutions tend to be fairly straightforward, wheat can be a pain. Either way, I will definitely be using the date filling recipe to fill my Christmas cinnamon rolls this year! Thanks!",

No more cinnabon cravings!!Out of curiosity, i had to calculate nutritional info for the whole thing based on 10 cinnabons, and they turned out to be either 196 calories per piece if used half the amount of dates mentioned (like my case, paste was runny so couldn't use more than half), or  225 calories if used the entire date paste mix. In comparison to the actua Cinnabon, that one has 800+ calories! I'd much rather enjoy my home made, cruelty free ones with zero guilt  :D",

I really appreciate all your work here and am a big fan in general. I want to say something very gently about the way you talk about food on your blog. You often speak about food as evil or dangerous or tell the reader that things are not healthy. I find this puzzling, and a little sad, and difficult to read for me personally with a history of disordered eating- it comes across as putting so much shame along with food. I wanted to gently ask if you could be mindful of the language that you use around food. If we can all reframe how we talk about food to remove moral language, then it will create a world with better mental and physical health. Thank you.",

I was quite nervous about experimenting with aquafaba, but once it started to foam up as i was beating it, i was highly relieved! I will definitely be making these again, thanks for the recipe!",

Would you/have you substituted gluten free all purpose flour (rice base, not dried bean base)?Thanks So Much!",
				"Hi there, I made these yesterday and they taste  great, however my batter was runnier then yours and the brookies ended up flat and sticking to the paper. I used 90ml of chickpea liquid  for aquafaba, but was I supposed to use 90ml of aqaufaba instead?  Aquafaba looked great and stiff , but perhaps I had too much of it. I measured everything else according to the recipe.",
				"Hi there, I used 90 ml of chickpea liquid which after beating it expanded a lot, so the volume looked like more, but maybe that's not where the problem lays. The aquafaba was really stiff although I used granulated sugar, not caster sugar. Would this create a problem? I didn't make any other substitutions.",
				"Hi Ania, I made them again, and  this time they were a SUCCESS  :). I beat the chickpea liquid for a very long time this time (my arm was numb afterwords :)) to make sure the aquafaba is really  really stiff  plus I was very careful when incorporating malted chocolate into it. I have added less sugar (just a personal preference) and I was very pleased with the result. Thank you for the great recipe, my family loves these so I will certainly making them again. Have a good day :)",

				"Ooops! I'd got too excited and scrolled straight to the recipe.  Sorry!  Explains why they aren't as light this time :(",

So often, a recipe for vegan ravioli calls for egg-roll wrappers as the \"pasta\" element in the dish, and if I actually have a package in my freezer, it's generally been forgotten about in the mists of time and I wouldn't dare use it. For Pinterest search purposes perhaps you could include 'fresh' or 'homemade' ravioli in your title?  Also, I couldn't decide which image to post: the beauty shot,or the image showing the dough being made. Perhaps you could embed a small image of the pasta making process in one of your pins?

But the sweet potato and avocado with the picked cabbage? Ummmm, YUM! I would have never thought to make that combination.

I live alone in a tiny flat in Hong Kong with very limited kitchen space but found the effort well worth it. In fact I\u2019ve made them twice! I found they freeze well. I also ended up spreading the prep - bake pumpkin after work on Thursday, make filling on Friday night and finish on Saturday morning. The fried version came out best, even using flax egg my baked ones cracked a bit. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I could eat these every day \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude1c",

				"I love, love, LOVE this salad. Probably my favourite one of all time. I decided to leave a review because I've made this recipe many times with various substitutions/alterations and hope that this info might help someone else out :- firstly, I make this without any nuts on it pretty much all of the time because they're too expensive for me to afford at the moment, even though this dish is absolutely DELISH with a bit of crunch. If you don't have any nuts on hand, please don't let it stop you from making this!!- I've made this with julienned/shredded carrot instead of red cabbage when I didn't have any on hand, and have also made it with red cabbage but using carrot instead of cucumber when I was out of that ingredient. If you're planning on eating this over a few days, I HIGHLY recommend subbing out the cucumber for carrot - the salad maintains it's freshness for much longer and doesn't get soggy. - I have made this with both mint, coriander and a mix of both before. It definitely tastes best with a mix of both, however the mint does get soggy after a day while the coriander seems to maintain its freshness for up to 3 (possibly longer, but I've usually finished this salad beforehand - it makes around 3 standard portions or 2 large)- lastly, instead of sambal I use sriracha and it tastes AMAZING in this salad. Recently I have also been omitting the extra tablespoon of neutral oil and find that the dressing tastes much stronger this way and the flavour of the sesame oil really shines through!Thanks so much for sharing this lovely recipe! :)",
				"Was a big hit at our ladies lunch.  Will be making this again soon.",
				"Best salad recipe ever. It\u2019s a fam favourite and in my top 3 most requested dishes.  We have a young toddler so we leave out the chilli paste and it still tastes amazing. I love that it doesn\u2019t use fish sauce which can be a bit overpowering and gives me tummy issues. We tend to have it with some hard tofu that\u2019s been pan fried until crisp! . My hubby loves to take it to work in his esky because often the building sites have no microwaves. Keeps well for almost 3 days! Thanks so much.",
				"This is the best salad dressing ever!!! We love this salad and have made it many times now. So simple and delicious and you can change it up to suit different tastes though the roasted peanuts are an absolute must! Sooo good :D",
				"This was super easy and one of the most delicious meals we've had!",
				"This couldn't be any easier!!!  I use the same bowl for softening the noodles as I do serving the dish so there is little clean up!!  Sometimes I buy precut veggies so there is no excuse not to make dinner!!!  And it's so yummy and it is CHEAP!!!  Thanks for a great great recipe!!",

I did it the no agar way and it turned out great. I remember ricotta not being that stiff of a cheese anyway, so I\u2019m curious how the agar one turns out as I feel like the no agar recipe is spot on with consistency.",

				"I attempted this ricotta recipe today to add to your pumpkin ravioli recipe. The ravioli dough and pumpkin filling have gone well. But this recipe completely flopped and I can't figure out why. It tasted tangy and fizzy at the end, so bad I had to bin it all after attempting to rescue it with sugar and bicarb soda. They only made it taste worse.Perhaps you have an idea where I went wrong. I'm wondering if it's because I used lime juice rather than lemon juice? Or perhaps I used the wrong type of miso. I also did a quick boil with line for the cashews as I forgot to do then overnight. I tasted the coconut milk and miso as I thought they could be the culprits, but both tasted fine, they hadn't gone bad. Do you have any thoughts to what was my clearly huge mistake?Thanks so much",

				"I tried your ricotta recipe for the spanakopita. I would have to say that the flavour and texture is very good but the coconut taste is overwhelming, and I love coconut. I wonder if I could try it again without the coconut fat because now I am scared the spanakopita will not taste right.  Since I hate wasting food I will give it a go with the recipe as it is. Maybe with the filling it won't be as strong. Fingers crossed!",

				"Hi Ania, Looks good! I will try this once I round up the ingredients.fyi: sometime ago, I read an old review of a dish of long green beans with fermented bean curd served at an iconic restaurant in Vancouver's China Town. The review described the fermented bean curd as tasting like parmesan. Since, then I have been meaning try it.On my last trip to the Asian Market in Kelowna, I purchased a teeny, tiny bottle of 'Che Che Fermented Bean Curd in Sesame Oil' (with chill). I was hesitant to try something so 'exotic', but at the first taste, I found it to be reminiscent of Cambazola, if it were marinated in sesame-chili oil. It is savoury, salty and has a kick of spice. The only veg I had to try it on was steamed, farm fresh cabbage. Not it's best pairing.  Next I tried it on toasted rounds of baguette. A win. It would be even better on Carr's Water Crackers.Katy",

I was transported to my favorite childhood Italian restaurant---like a Ratatouille moment--- was it something in the tomato sauce? The balsamic? Crushed roasted garlic? Minced capers?? Anyway, I didn't have pine nuts on hand and used pumpkin seeds instead. I figured the toasted seed would really add texture to the pasta and it did. The pumpkin seed was a fine substitution, but I'll have to try with the buttery pine nut next time. Absolutely loved the technique of roasting the garlic in the pan with its skin on. My mind is blown. I must buy more fennel and make this dish again!",
				"I made this yesterday & it was delicious!Super easy to make.Tasted healthy too.Definitely making this again :)",
				"Hi Ania,Just tried this recipe today and the flavors were wonderful.  However, I found that my fennel seemed really hard on the inside and uncooked.  The outside was charred, but the inside was not at all softened.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong (as I am new to the fennel world, after having your amazing soup the other day!) ... should I try cooking it longer on a lower heat?   Any tips would be appreciated!    Thank you!",

I skipped the step of tucking in the ends (just was working too fast and skipped over that part!). I am not even a baklava fan and I enjoyed this. The syrup did take a while to reduce down (tip for anyone who is not used to reducing down syrups like me!). I would daresay I could have used a teensy bit more of that syrup just to lap up. I also found I needed to bake the cigars a lot longer than the recipe called for (maybe because I was using a double layer of filo)? Fantastic recipe and really made easy something I thought was so super complicated to make, and vegan to boot!",

I made the syrup the day before and stored it in the fridge to ensure it was COLD when I brushed it on the cigars when they came out of the oven. I also just folded the filo in half so I used a whole sheet per cigar. And I ate two while still warm with a hot cup of coffee! DIVINE! Thank you for this recipe! <3",
				"Hi Ania, these look amazing, I've never made anything with filo pasty before so I am wondering if you could advice if it's OK to not apply any oil on the pasty before putting it in the oven? I can't have any heated oil for health reasons, it goes for any from olive to coconut, would it be enough if I brush the pastry with syrup mixture? Thank you!",

				"Yes i activated it, I followed the activation procedure.  It just wasnt enough agar agar powder.  But never mind!  We ate it as a frozen cheesecake, which works well for a hot Australian summer!  I will definitely be making it again.  The ginger in the cashew mix is a really refreshing twist.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ania.",
				"This is a great cake, but do your own tests and research on the amount of agar agar if using powder. My pack had no instructions so i followed the ones here, and it didn't set.",
				"Hello,I just made this wonderful recipe,I wanted to know if I could freeze it after it sets in the fridge?Many thanks,Karen",
				"For the base I have tried a similar technique, but only using a mix of Almond, Walnut and ground linseed (as a neat way to increase Omega 3 in  the diet) with rave results. I adapted the raw nut butter method. Using the nut mill that came with my stick blender I grind together the nuts and pre-ground linseed. However I stop just before it turns into a nut butter when it starts to come together but it's not smooth. At this stage is some of the nuts have become butter but some of them are still very fine crumbs. This mixture holds together very well by itself without any additions, and is yummy and healthy. You can just press it into the bottom of your cake tin and use as normal.",
				"This was easy to make, I used the mango pulp but I think I might have needed more agar agar . I tagged you on my instagram post at @kanchanseasycooking. Thank you so much for the recipe! I skipped the ginger part.",
				"I have a tin of mango pulp in the cupboard just dying to be used up. Would this work, since you pulped the mango anyway? If so, how much would you recommend I use? Thanks",
				"Hi Ania,This looks delicious. I was wondering if there is a substitute for agar agar or if there is anything else I could use instead?",
				"OMG the cheesecake looks so gorgeous  :) You're a vegan kitchen goddess, Ania! I'm drooling looking at the screen!",
				"I just made the cake and it was a total succes....its sooooo good...love it....\u2764\u2764\u2764",
				"Hi there I am planning to make this for a dinner with friends tomorrow. Sorry if it\u2019s a silly question but when you say coconut cream do you mean the solid bit at the top of a tin of coconut milk or I have bought \u2018coconut creamed\u2019 which is essentially a block of  coconut. It says you can make coconut milk by disolving 50 g in 100ml of water.  Should be fine on te Agar front as managed to get flakes \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd Thank you! Xx",
				"Hi Ania!  This recipe looks amazing. I am looking forward to try it. just wondering can I make it 24hr before serving and just leave in the fridge? Thanks! x",
				"I love your beautiful cake alot.....i have a question.......how it goes with the sides of the cake? i mean how it is puckered?tnx in advance",
				"Okayyyyy, I realized after I hit submit that the ratio for the agar powder is actually 2T : 16 oz (1 pint).  SO...with that in mind, this baby is all mixed up and sitting in the fridge. The leftover bits on the spatula tasted amazing. Fingers crossed it sets up properly. I have a feeling it will since HOLY MACKERAL no body mentioned that this stuff turns into SILICONE GASKET TYPE MATERIAL once its cooled!!! Warning to other neophytes DO NOT LET THIS STUFF DOWN YOUR DISPOSAL OR SINK. I was cracking up as I scraped any residue/remnants into the trash thinking Wow what a science experiment this was today!! ;-)",
				"Giving this recipe a try today. I have never used Agar either and all I could get locally was powder. With that said, the label does say to use 2 T : 8 oz of liquid so I am going to go with that ratio and see how it goes! Will keep ya apprised....Have a lovely weekend.Cindy",

				"Can I use raw almonds or should they be roasted, for the base?I'm making this today for Christmas :)Thanks!",
				"Thank you for this gorgeous and challenging recipe.I have not prepared food with Agar Agar before. It gave me a challenge. I only have a 20cm pan, so the base mix just covered the bottom luckily. I put it in the freezer in between layers for quicker cooling and setting.The centre was delicious and set well. The top didn't really set, but was amazingly delicious anyway.It took me quite a while to prepare this recipe (about an hour) as I hadn't used Agar Agar before and found it a bit fiddly. Other than that I found it was fairly straight forward.Thank you . I tagged you in my Instagram pic.I'm sharnaskindkitchen.:)",
				"Hi Ania!!Thank you so much for another amazing recipe!!! I made this yesterday and the taste is delicious!! BUT, although it is the first time I use agar agar, I don't think the flakes / powder amount is correct. I'm not sure though... I'm an agar agar beginner!! I used the powder, exactly as you said, but the cake didn't become solid enough in the fridge, so I had to put it in the freezer for a couple of hours, but it became more of an ice-cake... still delicious though, but I was really hoping to get the \"yelly\" cheesecake result. Perhaps I did something wrong? Next time I'll use the flakes!! Much love from the Netherlands,Lucia Flores",
				"Thanks for the quick reply, Ania!!! :) I don't know what I did wrong, but I'm gonne go with the flakes next time, since you use them frequently. I used the brand Lima, my mom has a lot of expierence with it. I heard her saying: \"Lucia, that is not enough!!\". But I told her this is what you recommended, so that's what I'm gonne use hihi. Anyway, I need to practice. Unfortunately I can't find the brand you use, but next time I will try the flakes from Terrasana, do you have expierence with this brand? I will try the strawberry cheesecake next, I'll let you know how it went! :)Have a great weekend!XOXO,Lucia",
				"I Used a Little more since i Read your Comment and still had to freeze IT. Its in the freezer Now And i am impatiently waiting to try IT. Will get the flakes But if using powder i Would use The Same amount As the flakes. I Used 3 Passionfruit ( only The juice) with the Mangos!! Passionfruit Addict \u2764\ufe0f Thanks for the Recipe. Will Send You Foto on Instagram \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",

I adapted the contents of the salad a bit - didn`t have any red cabbage  but used carrot and celery and zucchini (courgette) strips plus (vegan) Chinese noodles to pad it out. Coriander and cashews as stated, nearly didn`t bother to open my pack of black sesame seeds, but so glad I did - just gave it such an elegant finish! Can`t eat garlic any more, unfortunately, but it didn`t even need it - still tasted wonderful. Big hit with the family, too. Will definitely be making this again.

I just cooked quinoa as per your instructions and it turned out to be unbearably salty (had to rinse it twice with boiling water afterwards).

And I tried to find another way to rectify it. I'm not quite sure where it went wrong, I used coconut oil and sugar; which do not really \"cream\" like butter. The sugar just tried to dissolve into the oil. The aquafaba was tin, and it didn't whip up or anything either. But too much flour is what killed the filling I think.",
				"Thank you for the quick response. I think it may of been my ground almond flour. I weighed it, but I think it was my flour that made it overly thick and turned it into more of a dough. But I'm going to try again another time. But the taste and methods was good. Thank you!",

I think I'm ready to forgive and move beyond... chocolate crepe can do that to a woman. And thankfully they are hand mixed... because I still haven't replaced my piece. Thanks!!"

				"Thank you for the recipe, this may seem like a silly question but i was wondering if the chickpeas can then be used in dishes (eg hummus or curries) or if they shoukd be discarded? If so can they be used the same as canned chickpeas or is there any additional prep needed to use them? Thank you :)",
				"My chickpeas are now boiling when I found out your recipe. Sadly, I added baking soda when I boiled it. Will I still Elbe able to make aquafaba  with that water? Thank you very much in advanced!",
				"Thanks for the recipe. I tried to make myself. Just a small doubt. Can I pressure cook the chickpeas with the same quantity of water you have mentioned??? I pressure cooked the chickpeas and drained the water. I also whipped it. Everything comes perfect except the baked macroonsare sour.Please help me on the taste.",
				"My aquafaba turned out very dark.  I do not think it effected the taste but if I decided to make meringue kisses, I'd like them to be very white.  What can I do to get it lighter?",
				"Hi..Can I use this aquafaba in baking cakes?",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! Almost everywhere on the web recommends to just buy canned chickpeas for the water, but I always make my own  beans in the Instapot.  I made my garbanzos last night in the Instapot late, so I just let it sit overnight to cool.  This morning much of the water was gelatinous and stuck to the peas at the bottom of the pot.  I think (?) I had no choice but to rinse them just a bit to separate the pecs from the water.  I will probably end up having to boil down the water as you suggested, is there another way I could\u2019ve approached this? I won\u2019t be using the water right away but I do plan on using the beans today.",

				"Finding this super frustrating. Followed the instructions to the letter, including reducing. I\u2019ve been left with yellow water. Certainly nothing like the consistency\u2019s the aquafaba  from tinned chickpeas. It\u2019s been left in the fridge for two days, with the peas in too. :(",
				"The aquafaba thickens into a gel when refrigerated with the chickpeas in the liquid. This actually makes the best aquafaba.  Even though  the thick gel is yellow, itwill turn white when whipped. And it works fine mixed with ground Flax without whipping as a binder for quick breads or muffins or pancakes.",
				"Any tips for making this using a slow cooker? Usually we cook dry beans on low overnight.",
				"thank you for sharing! i want to ask. do we have to peel the chickpea's skin off ? is it necessary  ?",
				"Hi! Thank you for sharing all your tips!I have a question regarding to reducing the aquafaba as you say it\u2019s better not to do it if you\u2019re are using it for meringues. I\u2019m planning to try this recipe to make macarons and I wanted to know if you recommend me to reduce it a little bit or not. I\u2019ve tried making meringues plenty of times with homemade aquafaba but succeeded only the first time haha :( so I hope that following this tips I\u2019ll be able to make it right!",
				"Thanks for this info, Ania! Have you tried making aquafaba with an Instantpot? I can make chickpeas in about an hour from dry in an Instantpot, now I'm curious about the water. I'll try saving it next time, I'd love to make some mayo. Thanks for this inspiration!",
				"I\u2019m planning to freeze some small batches of this. Any tricks to freezing and thawing I should know about? This is my first time making my own aquafaba. Also, another question.... when making things with aquafaba, for example mayo, should it be used within the 3-4 day threshold?",
				"How much would an individual use in proportion of 1 egg?",
				"Hi Ania, thanks so much for this recipe! I followed the instructions exactly, including reducing the cooking liquid for about an hour. I was concerned with how thin the liquid seemed when it put it in the refrigerator with some of the cooked chickpeas. When I pulled it out of the refrigerator in the morning, my aquafaba was perfectly gelatinous and my vegan mayo had a much better texture than when I used the liquid from canned chickpeas!  I ended up with about 3 1/2 cups of aquafaba, so I had plenty to freeze for future use."

				"Do you think I could sub some of the zucchini for grated carrot without detracting from the dish?",
				"I didn't make these yet, but I usually bake things like that in the oven for 25-35 min  at 350 F  This way I need less oil and i flipp them once after half the time.",
				"Delicious once I got them right. First batch was an absolute mess. Then I added another 1/2 c flour and 1/4 bread crumbs (or more... I just kept going until it firmed up a bit). For me, it took more than 2 minutes to fry. Closer to 8 minutes for one side. Flipping them was work. They were so sticky and I had to move my spatula under the fritters with such care. I also couldn't fry as many at a time as I thought because I needed the room on the pan for maneuvering the spatula. I used all gluten free ingredients, so my theory is that it must have changed the consistency. I will use regular flour and bread crumbs next time and see if its less of a pain! Did anyone else have this issue? Maybe next time I will spread the zucchini on a baking sheet to get rid of extra moisture at the start. Squeezing the zucchini got rid of tons of water but maybe getting rid of even more would have made them less sticky too.... anyone else with the same experience?",

I added a pinch of cayenne powder to the coconut cream and mixed well before whisking it in as indicated on step 4.   The popcorn  turned out delicious.!! The hardest part for me was mixing the caramel and popcorn well to make sure that the caramel coats all the kernels.   By the way, have you tried to make Wasabi-flavoured popcorn?  So far, I have tasted the Bonsai brand and wish I could make it at home.",

The accurate name of this popcorn is Lesser Evil Buddha Bowl Foods Organic Popcorn Bonsai Wasabi.  The bag listed the following ingredients: Organic non-GMO popcorn, organic coconut oil, organic wasabi seasoning (organic evaporated cane sugar, organic tapioca solids, Himalayan salt, organic spinach powder, organic ground mustard, natural oil or mustard).

Finally after converting 7.5 teaspoons of agar flakes to 10 grams of agar agar strings the cake turned out to be firm, not really firm like yours in the picture. Your looks much nicer.",
				"Hi I would like to ask you is there a specific reason for the maple syrup, strawberries and cashew nuts in that order specified .  I  made the cheesecake and it was still a little runny.  I have had to put it in the freezer; whereas you recipe does not state to freeze it.",

It calls for 2Tbsp per cup of liquid when gelling acids. I'll definitely give it another go because the batter tasted great. We ate it with spoons",

I will try and remove the pits from the tamarind paste before I put it through the blender. I wasn't sure whether to blend in the water with the paste, but since it is called a sauce nat a paste, I believe the water had to go in the blender as well. I wasn't too sure how to put the sauce through a sieve (mine was probably much too fine), so I fished out the pits with my fingers.I had been looking for a good pad thai recipe for a while, and this is totally satisfying. No need to look any further: this is it. Thank you.",

I thought that it was a total of 135 ml of liquid (\"Pour 75 ml / 5 tbsp of boiling water and 60 ml / \u00bc cup of hot espresso\").  But in your comments to Jaycie, you said 75ml total.  Would you please clarify as I would like to make sure to do the right thing!  Thank you so much and have a great day!",
				"Hi! Love your recipes <3I don't normally drink coffee but have some instant in the house at the moment. How much should I use (e.g. how many tablespoons to how much water) to make an espresso?And then I imagine I add five tablespoons of hot water on top of that? Or is it a quarter cup of ground coffee and then add five tablespoons of boiling water?Apologies for my coffee ignorance :)",
				"It's so delicious! I baked it as a cake and it came out a bit too dry because I kept it in the oven too long.But it's so delicious. Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hello, i made these for the first time and they are delicious! Do you have an idea of the calorie count?",
				"Made these yesterday with GF flour and topped with chopped almonds. Left them in the oven for a little longer than the recipe suggests as they were more undercooked instead of fudgy. Mine don't hold their shape that well once out of the cupcake liner but I didn't really notice as I was too busy stuffing them into my mouth! If you've got a chocolate craving these are delicious and really hit the spot!",
				"Ania have you tried monk fruit sugar sugar in these along with gf flour? Thanks",
				"I made these with GF flour mix and brazil nuts and they are SO GOOD. The best GF and vegan cake I've had in a long time and certainly the best I've made. I needed that today.",
				"I tried many vegan brownie recipes before, but they weren't good. My non-vegan family got convinced that you can't make good vegan brownies. But these brownies are proving them wrong. Absolutely delicious and really easy to make!",

				"These did not work for me :( I followed the recipe but they just came out really thick and tasted like salt? I don't know what could have gone wrong.",
				"Hi Ania,Thank you very much for including the non-American measurements, I cannot tell how much time I have always spent calculating Fahrenheits to Celsius ! Not to mention the \"cups\" measurement that makes me nuts :D Most of my favourite vegan recipes are from the US so I  have to recalculate a lot of things for my European mind :DThank you for being so thoughtful about  followers from the rest of the world ;)Cheers,Szasza from Hungary :)",
				"So i made this with my 3yo... but I was totally distracted and didnt read the recipe properly. Realised after I started that I didnt have any chocolate!!! so I just added extra cocoa, extra coffee, I doubled the aquafaba and added a splash of milk to make the batter less dry... and SOMEHOW it worked out awesomely!!!Excited to try the \"real\" recipe soon !",

I baked them for 11 mins - I think next time I\u2019ll try 9. Could you maybe explain what they should be like when they\u2019re ready to come out? Like, springy top/still wobbly/whatever it is! I\u2019ve been dairy and egg free all my life so I\u2019ve NEVER made a truly successful brownie, so I don\u2019t really know what to look for to tell that they\u2019re ready! Thank you!",
				"I used only half  a cup of sugar and  next time I will bake it for 9-10 mins. They were still good. thanks.",
				"Ok. I just saw it... The sugar part was ommited by my brain... About the oil, for some reason I thought that the \"egss\" were either \"chia eggs\" or \"aquafaba with oir\"... so I didn't quite get it... I'm sorry and thanks... I'm really new to this...",
				"Hi there! I just made these brownies, and they did turn out to have a nice flavor, but I'm not sure they're at their best.... You never say when the oil and sugar should go into the mixture, so I ended up putting them in when I noticed and the best way I could... I actually had to add more water because my mixture turned out to be so thick that I couldn't even mix it up correctly...",
				"Early this morning... The babies were asleep, husband and dog asleep, and I couldn't shake the chocolatey pictures out of my head. Chopped the chocolate, was afraid husband or at least my dojjo would wake up due to the noise. Ate the last little bit of chocolate instead of chopping, just to be safe. But no. Not a peep out of anyone. All fast asleep. These brownies were SO easy to make and taste delicious! I was going to make your chocolate cookies at first, but the fudgy brownies reeled me right in. So glad they did :) The house smells fantastic. Thank you for a wonderful recipe \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0a",
				"Hi, do you think I could substitute some of the sugar for pureed dates?",
				"Hello I have a dinner party and would like to prep these then bake them not too long before serving (ideally they would still be a little warm) if I put batter in the fridge for few hours (thinking 4) would it still work?",
				"Fab! Had to make these as soon as I saw them. Put them in slightly too small cases (\u2018cos i\u2019m Lazy!), but I like a bulging top \ud83d\ude09. I cooked them for a couple of minutes longer, as I felt they were too squidgy still. Turned out great. Thanks Lazycatkitchen! Bonus - I made too much espresso, so topped the rest with warm almond milk and enjoyed that while they cooked \ud83d\ude03",
				"Thank you for the recipe! I made these for charity coffee morning and they went down very well! Only comment I can make - they should be eaten same day because they were very nice and had a crispy top just after cooling down but overnight they lost the crispness. That didn't affect the taste though. Tagged you in Istagram. :)",

				"So it has the crispy/chewy crust AND the fudgy center? Move over Nigella, I believe this is the answer to her oey-goey brownies (the ones with 1/2 kg of sugar and 1/2 dozen eggs aye?). I shall try it with my 90% Lindt bars just as soon as the ginger slice has been gobbled up.",

However, I was quadrupling to make a large quantity. My question to Ania is, are you using drained tins of whole tomatoes? or are you also using the juice from the tin?  I just found that (even though I was quadrupling everything) that this produced far too much sauce.",

In fact, a pretty popular concept for a day trip will revolve around planning to get to a hummus place in such a village, where the rest of the day trip is basically planned planned around that.

Since you used soba you should change your title to avoid confusion. Loving your choice of ingredients. I love using frozen tofu that's been thawed and the whey has been pressed out. If you cook it with the broth it soaks up the flavour and has a gentler soya flavour.",

Thanks again it was smooth and delicious. Anna",
				"Firstly I must come clean and admit that I didn't peel the chick peas. I set out to but half way through I called it a day. Like polishing the silverware my hands won't agree to follow what my mind commands. That being said the recipe was lighter than any hummus I have made before and the lemon and garlic danced on the palate . I even served it with a curried lentil stew and found that a dollop of hummus stirred into the stew made the whole concoction silky smooth and the heat of the stew bloomed the garlic in an addictive way.  I follow along with Aquafaba Hits and Misses and I was happy to see the substitution of aquafaba for oil.Thank you as always for the time and care you put into your recipes.",

So today I wanted to leave a comment because I am so so so so glad I stumbled across your blog and decided to try your recipes. And I am absolutely mind- blown. Everything I\u2019ve tried so far is absolutely delicious (Thai green curry and the Malabar curry), and this one here was an utter winner with  my husband and I. I am so so happy because we\u2019re recently married and I\u2019ve just started my hand at this cooking healthy and tasty meals everyday (while trying to bring him to the vegetarian side as much as possible), so I am so happy with how it has turned out so far.

We both loved it, and I am making it again tomorrow for his birthday, at his request!",

I will definitely have to try again using your other vegan meringue recipe :)Also I forgot to mention that I also subbed in sunflower seeds for the cashew nuts as a nut free option and it worked great! Thanks again, Chloe x",
				"I made one big pie using this recipe- I was so excited about this when I put it in the oven as the curd was delicious and the meringue looked really thick, smooth and glossy . Unfortunately when it came to cutting the pie the meringue seemed to have reverted back to very liquidy foam :((( I'm not sure why, as I whipped the aquafaba for a good 15 minutes and let the pie sit for a few hours before slicing. The only thing I did differently to the recipe was leave it in the oven to brown for about 10 mins rather than 2 - could this have ruined it? Thanks so much for the amazing curd recipe though - I subbed in limes for a delicious result! x",
				"Hi, thanks for this wonderfull recipe! I would like to know when you say cashews, do you refer to the fruit or the nut?",
				"I love making  your recipes! I don\u2019t really want to buy ramekins, do you have suggestions to use this recipe for a regular 9 inch pie pan?",
				"Just made these! Unfortunately the pastry was very hard so will have to modify next time. Curd and meringue came out perfectly though, the curd needed to be cooked a lot longer in order to thicken as I used coconut cream rather than cashews. I also added lemon rind to give it a nice bright yellow colour instead of turmeric. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
				"Made this today for my mum's birthday. Changed the recipe into a full sized pie and made 1,5 times the dough and 2 times the lemon filling. Tasted great! The merengue came out wonderful, didn't deflate when burning it and the lemon filling was nice, though it did taste slightly of cashews. The only thing I had trouble with was the dough. It came out quite crumbly since I wasn't sure of how much water to add. Thanks for the recipe!",

				"Hi Anita, I\u2019m used to making vegan meringue with egg replacer and this was my first go using aquafaba. I actually struggled to find chickpeas with no salt, I looked in several supermarkets. When I finally found some they were also organic (which is always a good thing right). However they were actually in VERY little water/juice so ended up using some of the only other kind I had which did have salt. The finished meringue had a peculiar flavor (in my opinion), almost \u2018nutty\u2019 and I wonder if that was from the salt?  I added vanilla and a lot more sugar to kinda disguise the flavor.  Wow, what a lot of meringue that one cup of aquafaba  makes!  I made a whole 9\u201d pie and will make lots of cookies with it too.",
				"The taste of this lemon meringue was AMAZING. I kept the ingredients as is and was able to make one big pie, although it wasn't very deep. Unfortunately, my meringue didn't firm up and it turned into a liquid mess when slicing. Overall the taste was incredible, but something went wrong with the meringue, so texture was off.Any ideas on where it could have gone wrong? I whipped up the aquafaba until stiff, then started adding in the sugar slowly. I had to whip it for a good while as my machine isn't very powerful, but I thought it seemed pretty firm at the end. It would hold stiff peaks. I put it in the oven 2-3 mins until brown, then let cool on the counter for 1hr, then in the fridge 30min. I've never made traditional egg meringues, so I'm not sure what to compare it to. My French husband said it looked stiff and ready to be baked, but he was surprised  that it was only for 2-3 mins. Maybe more cooking time? Maybe not whipped enough? Hmmm...Thanks for this recipe. I'll definitely be trying it again! Fingers crossed.",
				"Hi Ania,I made these recently and LOVED them, they were a huge hit. I've been dying for lemon meringue pies ever since I went vegan and i'm so happy to have them back in my life. I started prepping to make another batch - only problem is my brother accidentally threw out my aquafaba! Might seem a silly question, but do you think I could freeze the lemon curd for use at a later date? I've got cashews soaking that are just going to go to waste otherwise.",
				"Hi Ania,Love these! Have you ever tried using any kind of sugar substitute in your aquafaba meringue? I'm vegan and sugar free, so I would love to have a sugarfree meringue, if it is possible.Thanks,Fanni",
				"This recipe is amazing. I\u2019ve never made a lemon meringue pie I was happy with and since going vegan 5 years ago I had written it off. But it is my hubby\u2019s favourite. I made it yesterday within an hour start to finish and it looks fantastic and professional and the taste is unbelievably light and fluffy. Very impressive! Thank you.",

				"Hi! I have a corn allergy and I substituted cornflour for a little bit of oat flour and xanthan gum powder. My lemon curd came out very yummy, but smelled a bit like play dough. I was wondering if the corn flour has a very important roll in the curd and maybe I should try potato starch.",

It blew my mind.",
				"Hi ,I have made Ottolenghi 's recipe for Blackpepper Tofu ,it is delicious but I used Food52 'S recipe version because it  uses much less butter. Your recipe seems less labour intensive! To have very firm tofu I freeze it first and then weigh it down with a cast iron frying pan, works really well.",

We used ground ginger instead of grated, vegetable oil instead of peanut, soy sauce, brown sugar, and no sesame seeds. Will definitely be making this recipe again.We also let the oil heat up a little too long, so the tofu cooked a bit too quick. It didn't burn, luckily- it was our first time cooking with tofu, so we made sure to keep a close eye on it.",
				"Tried my first recipe from your site - Vegan black pepper tofu - it was very yummy! I added some water since the `sauce` soon disappeared. Felt it needed something else to eat with it, so served it with an Asian kale salad and some leftover stir fried vegetables. Went down very well with the family! By the way, I think there was a mistake in the recipe - step 6 repeated what I`d already done in step 4. Thanks for your great ideas - I love looking at them!",
				"Hi Ania,I thought it was a bit different originally, but haven`t got my printed out copy any more (wrote it into my recipe book by hand!). It all seems to be correct now, so either you`ve already corrected it or I need new glasses!Love, Wendy",
				"I've just finished eating this - it's lovely, I highly recommend it. My other-half even enjoyed it and he isn't normally keen on my chinese cooking attempts. I will definitely be eating this again. This is my first recipe from this site and after eating this I'm looking to see what I can cook for tea tomorrow from Lazy Cat Kitchen."

				"Hi Ania,I have been dying to try out this recipe and finally got round to it. SO glad I did - it was fantastic! I did the buckwheat exactly as you said - and it tasted so much better than I`d ever made it taste before. The spices and dressing complemented each other so well - and I learnt (from You Tube) to de-seed a pomegranate for the first time (bashing it with a wooden spoon method). Thanks so much. Will definitely be making this again. I could imagine it as a very posh starter ... but bet people wouldn`t be satisfied with just a little serving! Sorry I can`t send a photo - technically unable - but it looked just like yours (only my parsley was chopped small). So I was very proud of it!"

Oh dear)Now it's cooling in the fridge... can't wait to roll them in cocoa powder! Won't be adding sugar to coat it it's already VERY sweet. Will put less dates next time...",

				"Great recipe - I would change out the canola oil though (it\u2019s toxic) and also avoid tinned tomatoes - find glass instead. With acidic food, the metal cans have a liner which is an endocrine disruptor. Other than that, perfect . Roasting the pumpkin works very well.",
				"Probably the best marsala paste I have made - the dish worked well with *&%$ ( quickly sauteed before addition ) but I omitted the maple syrup - us non Nortern Americans don't need the extra sweetness.",
				"This was a really lovely recipe. I added some chick peas I roasted and omitted the chillis as was making for kids. Made the sauce in my pressure cooker a day ahead, combined to heat through and was full of flavour.",
				"This was a delicious curry and used up a Halloween pumpkin.   Do you happen to know how many calories are in a serving.?  We had this on a low calorie day on our diets.  Will make this again.   Very nice.",
				"What a fabulous curry! Got a pumpkin in my veg box, and this is the perfect warming autumn dish to make with it! Lovely blend of spices, great consistency and flavour. I added some red lentils (pre-cooked) and roasted the pumpkin first, as suggested. Big hit with the family.",
				"Yummilicious. It is fall, and for the first time I am cooking pumpkin \ud83c\udf83. I loved the idea of roasting it with a drizzle of olive oil. Also being an Indian I had all the spice you mentioned. It was a smooth ride making this aromatic dish! My family polished it off in a jiffy. Changes made omitted garam masala as we don\u2019t like the heat it generates and substituted maple syrup by a pinch of sugar. This is a keeper!",

				"Hi Ania - This is definitely my new 'go to' vegetarian curry recipe! I have made it with roasted pumpkin and also with roasted butternut squash - the pumpkin held its form better but both were tasty. The spices were a perfect blend , and while Premium coconut milk is always the richer flavour, it was still really good with reduced fat coconut milk. I like to add chickpeas and sometimes cauliflower. I use maple syrup every chance I get, but when I ran out, used brown sugar - yum to that! Served over brown basmati, with steamed baby bok choy.  So delicious! Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Oops, I don\u2019t think I hit the star rating when I submitted my comment. Definitely a 5/5!",
				"This was absolutely delicious! I think I could eat it every day and it will definitely be making a regular appearance in our  dinner rotation. The only change I made was to eliminate the tomatoes because I\u2019m allergic to them and  I \u201cheaped\u201d the spices except for the Chili powder. Thank you for sharing!",
				"Made this tonight and loved it. I used fresh squeezed coconut milk which really made it perfect. This is the first recipe of yours I\u2019ve tried. Now I\u2019ll be sure to try some of your others.",
				"I love this recipe. It has a great consistency, not too thick, not too runny. Great flavor, nice way to use any leftover pumpkin. I made a few changes to make it more kid friendly: omitted fresh chili, decreased hot chili powder to 1/8 of a teaspoon and used cardamom instead of mustard seeds (I didn't have mustard seeds at home and I love cardamom).",
				"My husband cooked this tonight after I sent him the recipe and it was DELICIOUS. Definitely a keeper! Thank you!",
				"We had been saving a Seminole pumpkin for a special dish and this was just the one to use it in! We made it last night (thankully a double batch) and took it over to my dad's and wife's for dinner.  We were all amazed at our good fortune! This was one of the best things I've ever made or eaten. I don't normally like to use so many superlatives, but they are necessary here! We didn't use any hot chilis, and left out the maple syrup, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We also made the spicy kale (without the spice) and it too, was fabulous and a perfect accompaniment to this dish. Thank you so much for sharing this! I can't wait to make more of your recipes!"

I tweaked it a little because I can't have coconut in any form or use as much oil (I have MS and the programme that I follow has limits on certain fats and oils) and I didn't have any walnuts so used pecans left over from Christmas. After baking I realised that I'd accidentally grabbed the ground nutmeg instead of cinnamon, and been rather generous with it, too, but I was delighted with the result so will purposefully make the same choice next time. And there will definitely be a next time as the 2lb loaf was voted delicious by my sons and gone in a couple of days! A lovely moist cake with no real taste of bananas, thank you very much :0)",

I also thinned the sauce slightly with a little of the pasta water and a generous dollop of white wine.This will be a favourite, I\u2019m sure of that.",

I'm catering a Christmas party on Saturday night and needed some vegan options so I was planning on making up the little patties today, then freezing them to be able to bake them off from a frozen state at the party on Saturday night.  But I was wondering if it might be better to form them, bake them off today, THEN freeze them and simply warm them in the oven at the party.  Do you have any experience one way or the other with making these ahead and freezing them?  I'm grateful for any insight you would care to share!  And thank you for a really delicious recipe - I've scoured the internet for something like this and have made several other iterations of sweet potato falafel but nothing comes close to being as good as yours!  Your weights, measurements and instructive video are also on point!",

I didn\u2019t coat them in any seeds and they were still amazing. Great hot or cold and if you make them into bigger patty shapes they make great burgers! Just wonderful \ud83d\ude0a",

				"Hi Ania,I've not managed to try these yet as I have everything I'm just waiting for my oven to preheat.I think maybe the time taken is a bit misleading, whereas I will accept the chickpeas may need to be soaked overnight (or bought pre soaked) there is still an hour for your potato, followed by half an hour of cooking.I'm looking forwards to trying them and think the feedback above is a great reference for how these will turn out.Dave",

They were full of flavour and really easy to make. Great recipe!Instead of baking the sweet potato, I steamed  it (as that was way quicker).",
				"Would it work if I sprouted and cooked the chickpeas before making the patties? Thanks",
				"Hello Ania,I love your ideas and style!I did not have sweet potato at home so I had to improvise. I was thinking to add a pinch of fructose instead (I do not consume other sugars), but I relied entirely on the sweetness of the chickpeas. What I did though is mimic the sweet potato consistency by taking 1/3 of the mixture and making it into a humus like consistency. I baked the falafels without the potato (and without the garlic). They still turned out extremely tasty. I cooked with slightly pre-boilled chickpeas. I used dill for the tahini sauce and it happens to be a good mix.I got the huge quantity of chickpeas as a result from experimenting with aquafaba. I am miserably failing with all aquafaba recipes, I am guessing that it is because I have to replace sugar with fructose and they do not act the same in heat and with protein. I am not giving up yet, but it is a challenge.Thank you for the great work and beautiful videos!",

I\u2019ll make a Victoria sponge (dairy free) but not really eat any, the same with flapjack. This recipe however, this has smashed it out the water. I\u2019ve never made caramel before so I was chuffed how that came out. I thought I had tart baking cases but after recently moving and most of my kitchen/baking ware in storage and using my mother in laws due to lack of space, I ended up using one of my cake tins for the tart. As I didn\u2019t want the delicious caramel to ooze our as it was a big tart, when my caramel clumped together, I didn\u2019t add more milk, this really helped to have a firm caramel, whilst still not solid. I also made extra ganache, I used 135g of chocolate, and worked on the basis of 15ml less coconut milk to the weight of the chocolate. That was definitely a wing, but it worked, although I didn\u2019t add any water. It\u2019s so yummy & I\u2019m so grateful for your recipe. Thank you very much!!",

Did I get it wrong or are the pastry cases supposed to be like that?",

				"Can you add sultanas or raisins to the bread?",
				"Can I use stoneground wheat flour?",
				"A really simple recipe with great results. The bread was soft and fluffy inside, and reminded us of the bread we had in Istanbul. Will definitely make again!",
				"I've been making this bread for a long time now adding various toppings including chilli flakes, nigella seeds, garlic granules and mustard seeds. It has become a regular in our house between baking everyday loaves and tiger bread. Thank you for sharing the recipe.",
				"Well it definitely took alot longer than than I was expected..it would have been nice for you to put that prep time includes the hours it takes for yeast to rise for those who have never used it before.... Cause it took ALOT LONGER than 20 min to prepare to cook it...allowing the yeast to do its thing is part of the prep time so In my opinion this isn't as advertised at all.. Nothing beats homemade bread though",
				"OMG this was faboulous And oh so easy!  I might make it every day.  We had tried a Turkish bread for the first time 2 days before from Sultan's Middle Eastern Market in Tampa and loved it.  Since I had citric acid and the market brand contained it, I added a 1/4 teaspoon.  I assume it would help it last longer.  I will not know as this will be gone tonight!",
				"It's my standard bread recipe. I do it every couple of weeks, particularly for summer BBQ",
				"This bread is easy and super delicious.  Thank you for all your great recipes.  Served with chilli,  with vegan chilli dark chocolate in,  made it rich and smooth!",
				"I had different breads in upper north east all my life many Nationalies are the interesting & educational",
				"can i use half of wholemeal flour and half of normal flour?",
				"Hi Ania, thank you for the recipe.  Mine turned out not exactly what it should be but never the less, it was delicious. I like the chewiness of how the Turkish bread turned out.  I was accidently on the wrong setting on the oven. :-( Luckily I turned out before it started getting too burn.  It was still delicious and amazed how easy it is.  Thanks again.",
				"Absolutely awesome recipe, love it, so simple and delicious. Thank you.",
				"Hi, I  absolutely love your bread recipe! Do you have the nutritional information posted somewhere?",
				"my dough didn't double in size- not sure why? I left it to prove a further half hour but the loaf was lovely but small",
				"This bread is so easy and delicious!  It is very similar to Ramazan Pide but without the eggs and yogurt .  I have made this nearly every night during Ramazan to help me and my Turkish husband break our fast.",
				"I haven't tried this yet, but am very much looking forward to it. We lived in N7 for a year and there was a Turkish grocer at the corner of our street. We bought way too many of these, and were always heartbroken when they had none left. Looking forward to  making (and devouring) this on the weekend.",
				"The oven surely goes pretty high and is adequate size to make one bread at a time of say 9\" diameter.  Oven can one go higher than 250 celcius easily. I would make it one of these days. It should taste very nice with some Korma or other complex Indian curries. Many foods from turkey to middle east to central asia to afghanistan pakistan and northern India are modifications of similar recipes. The similarities are the norm as are subtle variations. Thanks for your response. I am just learning to bake though, but I am an expert on curries!",
				"HiI am in India. I recently bought a Pizza Oven of brand G3 Ferrari. Its a stone oven heating at top and bottom with 600 watt elements on both top and bottom and goes up to 380/390 deg celcius or 725 deg F. This Pide ramazan bread recipe is very interesting and  I want to try baking itin my Pizza oven. The oven has a basic thermostat  to control temperature but  does not have a thermometer so to say to give exact temperature for baking. Having said that I can measure temperature on the stone using a IR thermometer.My question is can such a bread be done at higher temperature. How sensitive is final product to temperature. Higher temperature is an advantage or a disadvantage for such bread.The oven  can be opened to see the appearance of the bread and assess its doneness.....experience can eventually allow such a nice bread to be made proficiently but should my starting point be a slow bake at low or fast bake at high/higher.",
				"Great recipe! Nice and easy with very tasty results. I hunted down some nigella seeds (\u00e7\u00f6rek otu) to use along with the sesame seeds on top, which adds to the flavour I love most about the is bread.",
				"I regularly visit a Turkish shop about a mile from home and love their bread so I had a go at making this. It turned out reasonably well but it was a little dense. I used  bread flour, perhaps I could try just plain flour? I will also check my yeast to see if its actually instant. I dont think the water used was warm either.. Anyway looking forward to having another go soon.Also when is guacamole not guacamole?  When it's a salad!  I tried to make some recently and waited until everything else was done before splitting my avocados. They were rotten! So plan B, I added a tin of tuna and ot was awesome!",
				"I am not sure what I did wrong but my bread came out dense and didn't rise much.  I followed measurements exactly for flour and water but I had a rather dry dough, not wet at all.  I did add little more water and let it rise for the time itt said.  Any tips so I can be successful next time?Thanks for any tips.Nosheen",
				"Just found this recipe and so excited to try it! Are there any kind of dips that go well with it? Just want to make sure I'm keeping it authentic as possible!",
				"Can we use brown bread flour or wheat flour instead of bread flour which I assume is the normal white one?",
				"I made this as part of a Greek/Mediterranean New Year's Eve meal last night and it was amazing! So easy to make and delicious - can definitely see this becoming a regular feature on the menu. Thank you Ania and  Duncan!",
				"A little update - when I made this bread originally I wasn't looking for a \"vegan\" bread but rather an easy & delicious Turkish bread recipe in which this absolutely is. I had mentioned that I even used the same recipe to make pizza dough which the kids (and neighborhood kids) loved as well. For the new year I am trying a 30 day Vegan cleanse and I can't wait to try more of your recipes. I watched \"what the health\" on Netflix and it was really mind blowing. Hope that the 30 day Vegan adventure will help with my arthritis. Any tips on Vegan diet that only includes whole foods (not planning to use flour, wheat, white rice, etc.).  Thank you in advance.Warmest wishes for an amazing 2021",
				"I made this and it came out great. I was a little skeptical because I wasn\u2019t sure how much flour to add after the first rise. Some more comments how the dough should feel after the first rise would be helpful.",

When viewing the synopsis and assuming it looks like 30-40 mins to make, when coming to make it there are two proving times required of total 1hr 45 mins??!!

				"What can I say - DELICIOUS and EASY!! Every Ramadan we look forward to going to the Turkish mosque for their soup & bread that they serve to break the fast. It\u2019s an amazing experience. This year due to Covid - we were unable to go to any mosque during Ramadan. I know how to make Turkish lentil soup and Yayla (yogurt/mint/rice) soup. But when I make it I have to make a special trip to Brooklyn to get Turkish bread (or else my daughter won\u2019t eat the soup). Well - this recipe CHANGED EVERYTHING! I spent months afraid to attempt it as I can\u2019t even master Pita bread. Yesterday I said well - it\u2019s vegetarian night so let\u2019s try.  I was skeptical as I only have regular flour in hand as well. OMG! It came out wonderful. I made 2 loaves and the bread was gone and no one even finished their soup! We also served olives in a garlic/olive oil/oregano/basil mixture and the kids dipped the bread in it - just like when we go to our favorite Turkish restaurant in Brooklyn (Istanbul).  It was so good that I made another batch today and used the same recipe as my homemade pizza base (just added sauce, mozzarella, fresh basil and halal pepperoni). KIDS LOVED IT!!! Thank you! Thank you! I shared the recipe with my sister as well since one of  her kids is vegan."

				"These look delicious!! Is there any substitute for tahini that I can use?",
				"Made these tonight and they were so good! I was hesitant-- I thought they'd be more of a savory cookie or at least a less sweet \"tea\" cookie but they were surprisingly sweet (not too much) and good! The maple syrup was just the right amount. I did add the sesame seeds and I loved them that way. You can easily leave that off and it'd be great. I used the ground oats as the flour option. I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!",
				"I love this recipe and have now used it twice! It's so quick and easy. The cookies taste yummy and healthy. I use ground almond (same quanitty) instead of walnuts because I can't blend up nuts to a flour and it works perfectly. I also cooked them without the sesame seed coating - and they are still good. My non-vegan friends love them just as much as me. Perfect :)",
				"Hi:) Great recipe! Can we skip the fridge part before putting in the oven, if we don\u2019t have that much time?",
				"Thank you Ania! I'll give the sunflower seeds a go.",

				"hi, I love these cookies! Fridge is helping sesame seeds to stick? I skipped fridge, and seeds are separated now :(",
				"Wow! These are sooo delicious!! They have the perfect amount of sweetness and slightly chewy texture! My husband said it\u2019s like a mix between a cookie and halva(and we sure love halva). I didn\u2019t have walnuts on hand, but had pecan nut instead. I can\u2019t wait to try these with walnuts next time! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hi I am Emanta from The Netherlands and  against my autoimmune diseases I am on a vegan diet without gluten, lactose, sugar, chocolate. Do you have recipes for me too?Thanks so much. Kind regards, Emanta",
				"Thanks so much for this recipe!  I\u2019m making it for the second time right now.  This time I\u2019m using half spelt flour and half white and they taste very similar, atleast as good as the first batch, which everyone loved.  They are not too sweet and I feel good about giving them to my toddler as a nice source of iron and calcium.  They remind us of the sesame biscuits we often ate for breakfast in China when we lived there some years ago.  Yum:)",
				"I changed a few things. I used brown rice flour and instead of the sweeteners you used, I used 100% dates so there was a measurement discrepancy on multiple levels to make them strictly whole food, plant based but omg!! First time I ever have managed to make a crunchy biscuit since turning plant based! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Also, I've been struggling to gain weight but I have a feeling that's about to change. Haha! Thanks again.P. S. Tahini is a gift from the gods!",

				"These biscuits are delicious, I have made them about three times now, they are so tasty with a soy cappucino. The biscuits look so good, when they have been baked too",
				"These were truly incredible; even my bestie who isn't normally a fan of \"healthy alternatives\" thought they were amazing! I used almond flour instead of all purpose and just doubled the baking soda, and I mixed some cacao nibs through as well. They had a lil bit of crunch on the outside and were deliciously soft on the inside. Thanks so much for this recipe!",
				"Is the maple syrup necessary for the texture, or just sweetness? Can it be left out without affecting the texture? I don't have any on hand... perhaps a granulated sweetener like stevia or coconut sugar would work?",
				"Hi Ania, these sound delicious. I want to 'bake ahead' for a party. How long do the cookies keep?",
				"Does whizzed mean you put it in the food proccesor?",
				"I completely glossed over the instruction that said the refrigerate first! Woops... But, I must say, the cookies still turned out delicious! I think they puffed up more in the oven than they would have had they been refrigerated, but that's okay with me! I also cooked them more around 15 minutes, and used gf flour and almond flour as I had no  walnuts on hand. Will certainly make them again, hopefully with the right ingredients and steps next time, haha.",
				"This just came up on my Facebook feed today. We are planning on making these this afternoon with my daughter and her husband. I am so looking forward to this!",
				"I made your cookies, and they were just delicious. The only thing I added was a light spread of honey glaze on each cookie after they had completely cooled and another generous sprinkle of lightly roasted sesame seeds over each. For some reason, I rarely find a vegan cookie recipe I want to make over and over again, but this one I definitely will. Thank you!",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! Didn't have quite enough maple syrup so substituted one of the tablespoons for one of honey, but the cookies came out well and had a lovely flavour. I also love the sesame seeds on top - so pretty!",
				"hi there! these cookies look awesome, but I have no  whizzed walnuts, can I use  whizzed hazelnuts instead?",
				"Hi.  I was  wondering if you w ould be able to provide conversion of cookie ingreadients  to  cups...thank you!",
				"great recipe Ania! tahini is one of my favourite \"undiscovered\" ingredients ( I love it stirred through a tomato based sauce - try it!)just a quiet word of advice though in regard to oat flour. it actually isn't gluten free ;-)",
				"Oh my! Finally a healthy cookies recipe that really works! Thanks for sharing this Ania! They are so good and easy to make. Even with my terrible oven they turn out just great!",
				"OMG, I am not usually a big fan of tahini but I thought those cookies looked so pretty, healthy and easy to make that I decided to give them a try.... Thanks godness I did, those are DELICIOUS. I am in love. Thanks for the recipe. x",
				"Best cookies ever!!! I love sesame and walnuts - both make an unbeatable taste combination for these cookies. Warning: you won't be able to eat just one :) Bonus: it's a calcium rich whole foods \"unguilty\" pleasure",
				"I just made these yesterday.  These are definitely going to be this years holiday cookies i give away to friends and family. They reminded me so much of the sesame cookies my Italian great-grandmother would make. One bite and they took me right back to her kitchen in Brooklyn. Great recipe!",

				"The first thing I thought of when I saw the tahini cookie headline was the \"benne seed\" cookies popular in Charleston, South Carolina (USA).  Those are a crispy wafer/cookie though.  But benne seeds are sesame seeds, so I'm wondering how the flavor of this will compare.  I'll have to make it and see! :)"

Note that the amount of agar changes if you are using powder instead of flake, and I definitely recommend sieving after using the flake, as not all of it will dissolve. I use slightly more agar flake (I just round the tsp. instead of level it) to account for the bit that gets sieved out and it comes out great every time. Thank you for sharing!",

I was going for this sandwich, but never got around to cutting and grilling the eggplant last night, and the store was out of zucchini when I went, so I got summer squash instead.  I also grilled up one red, one orange, and one yellow pepper, so I had one slice of red and one of yellow on my sandwich today.  I also added portobello mushroom slices (also grilled).  I was going to add fresh tomato, but I forgot to slice it before assembling my sandwich this morning, and didn't feel like taking the sandwich apart and adding once the sandwich had actually gotten kind of together in my lunchbox.Oh, shoot, I also just realized I forgot to pick some basil for it... that would have been good.I also made the tapenade with some kalamata, some \"natural\" green olives, and a little bit of marinated artichokes (and capers). But other than being completely different, it was totally this sandwich.  and it was delicious.  I might actually grill up the eggplant tonight, and add it to future sandwiches, since I still have plenty more of the other veggies."

				"Hello,Do you think I could use the same base to make little buns or would I need to make some changes (apart from cooking time)? This is my favorite brioche recipe but I made it for Christmas morning so I wanted to change it up and make little chocolate and orange buns for tomorrow morning.Happy New Year to you both!Verena",
				"Made it yesterday and we managed to eat half of it at once (it was humongous)! Really delicious, fluffy and great texture. Chocolate and walnuts is such a great combo. I used a mixer with a kneading hook to make the dough and gave it a few 'hand kneads' at the end just to check if it was ready. I added 'NO Egg' egg replacer, cardamom and melted vegan butter to the dough. Didn't have any strong flour and used all purpose instead. Also i used vegan Nutella for the filling. This is my best attempt with vegan sweet bread so far! I tried some recipes with pumpkin puree and whipped aquafaba but the texture wasn't nearly as good. Even my partner who doesn't care about food in general (unlucky me) was absolutely sold on this challah! Thank you!",
				"Sorry for the odd timing of the question...Is it okay to use normal /regular yeast (small block stored in the fridge) instead of the dried one?Thanks a lot for all the great recipes, always love them and  best of luck with creating your new home together!!",
				"Thank you for the recipe, it was amazing! Quite a lot of work and time-consuming, but well worth it! I omitted the bread flour and doubled the amount of all-purpose flour, it worked just fine. I also used only 90g of walnuts (that was all I had in the kitchen) and it was the perfect amount for me. Will definitely make it again!",
				"This looks fab! BTW, I just joined your mailing list on the promise of a Sweets e-book, but none arrived. Can you tell me where I can get it?Thanks",
				"Thank you for the recipe ! It was my first time making bread and it  did a little twist . I replaced walnuts with dried cranberries and pecan so it can balance out the sweetness of the dark chocolate and I can still  have the crunchiness from the pecan :)",
				"Just watched the video on Facebook. This looks awesome!",
				"Can I use cocoa powder instead of chocolate bars?",
				"This recipe is amazing, I ate the whole challah to myself over the past 3 days. I had no walnuts available so I used raspberries instead and it worked fine. I can't wait to make it again for my family. Thank you so much",
				"I can't wait to try it out,  the ingredients seem pretty simple, My mouth is already watering just thinking about it!",
				"Hi Ania.  Look like a really great recipe.  Have a question.  Can I use a dough hook on on a mixer to combine the ingredients and knead?  Or will it not have the same effect as hand kneading.",
				"Dear Ania and Duncan,Great site you're running here! I just tried making your chocolate mousse with aquafaba. It turned out beautifully :) I look forward to my husband's reaction tomorrow when he tries it. He is a big chocoholic in love with chocolate mousse.I have a quick question regarding this recipe that I am planning on trying later this week. What is the difference between strong and all-purpose flour? Here in Denmark I can buy either white or whole wheat flour.Thanks!",

Even after whipping for 30 min couldn\u2019t get the Aquafaba not to slide, despite having used completely grease free utensils? So I gave up on it.

It was astounding to see bean juice become what looked like stiff egg whites \ud83e\udd2f I never imagined that I\u2019d be getting protein from beans in my chocolate mousse, but this stuff is good! Like I\u2019d serve this to other people.. good! If you want to do a quick fun cooking experiment some evening, get yourself some chocolate and a can of garbanzo beans. You\u2019ll amaze your friends and family. For sure! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc9a",
				"Amazingly simple and looks and tastes so delicious. The first time I made this I skipped the sugar but when making it for others who wanted a sweeter mousse and my  chocolate had very little sugar, I added a tbsp more sugar. It tasted great topped with chopped mango.",
				"Tried this recipe for the first time as was curious to see how it would turn out, and never having used chick pea juice as a substitute for egg whites. What a revelation!  I had the aquafaba cool, not chilled and not exactly at room temperature. I used ordinary dark chocolate however I boiled the water in the kettle first, put it in the pan then placed the bowl of chocolate over it so melted it slowly. I found by doing it this way I didn't overheat the chocolate.  I then let stand for about five minutes before adding it to the whisked aquafaba. I used a silicone spatula and folded it in slowly.  The result....... a delicious mousse that my husband has declared the best! Win win all round.",
				"I made this with 90% cocoa chocolate and despite my best efforts it seized. But this has happened before with other similar recipes and I have found that carefully stirring in a few glugs of avocado oil loosens it enough to enable it to blend perfectly with the aqua faba. End result is a fabulously smooth, darkly chocolaty, velvety mouse.",
				"My family goes crazy for this mousse! Thank you so muchCiao from your fan from Torino!Susanna",
				"Hi, can I freeze this mousse? I accidentally made too much of it\ud83d\ude05.Many thanks ;-)",
				"I made this recipe for a New Years dessert with close friends and followed the recipe to a tee. It looked fine when it was placed into the fridge, but upon taking it out a little while later, the chocolate had seized and the texture was terrible (fluffy Aquafaba, firm dark chocolate bits). It tasted good, but there is no way I would serve this to friends. Very disappointing.",
				"This is the second year i have made this for a Christmas treat and it is delicious! I use 70% dark choc from my local bulk foods, i found that it worked better than the block stuff from the supermarket. Super easy and quick to make",
				"This looks delicious and I would like to try it. Is it possible to substitute cocoa powder for the chocolate?",
				"Mine went all grainy when I added the chocolate, I used room temp aquafaba and the chocolate was definitely cool. I did use half 85% eating chocolate and then half 40% cooking chocolate, could that have been the problem?",
				"Fabulous. I\u2019ve recently become terribly lactose intolerant, and I couldn\u2019t  even tell that this was dairy free. Used 72% percent chocolate chips, and  held the chili. Came together quickly and deliciously! Served it with coconut whipped cream. Will make again and check out more of your recipes! Thanks!",
				"I made this and it turned out grainy. I let the chocolate cool down, but maybe not enough? I see some other comments of people adding plant based milk to their chocolate but I don\u2019t see that in the recipe. Should I try adding milk with my chocolate or just let it cool even more before adding it to the whip next time? Thanks :) I really want this recipe to work for me",

				"Hlo! Thanks for the great recipe, we made some yesterday and they were delicious :D one find we had: if you bake them in a hot pan with some olive oil, they become even fluffier and softer for extra tastiness and curry absorption abilities. Naans are originally baked in a Tandoor grill - so the fast heat increase is essential to getting lots of oven spring. Cheers!",
				"Fab recipe,  these turned out brilliantly,  and were perfect with the pumpkin and coconut curry.  Thank you!",
				"Hi what is strong flour referred in Australia",
				"I made these the other week and although they smelt and tasted fantastic, my wholemeal flour meant that they came out rather 'dense' not fluffy like a regular naan. More like a pitta, I guess. Gutted. I also sneaked a bit of crushed smoked garlic into the dough - the flavour was amazing. Would you recommend just using plain flour, or maybe 50/50?",
				"Hi all! I'm new to the vegan cooking world, and I have just one question about your recipe! What is a possibility in terms of \"strong flour?\" I'm not familiar with what flours are considered a strong flour. I appreciate the help!

It reminds me of all the dinners with my dad on our \"father daughter date nights\" when we would choose an ethnic restaurant to dine at and we would almost always end up at an Indian restaurant.

I do have a question about a bread roll recipe I love... when I use homemade meal vs store bought, the rolls are more dense, dry and smaller.

Should I try reducing the amount of homemade meal in the recipe to see if it works better? Any advice would be great.Thanks, Suzi.",

Best thing is I have all of these ingredients at home, and I have been experimenting with espresso coffee instead of orange juice and and adding peppermint extract in the end, my favorite so far.The spices and vanilla really works well and some crushed pistachios instead of cacao to roll them in makes a pretty contrast. It's important to be accurate with the measures of the coconut milk I have noticed, a slight bit too much and it doesn't set as well.The next batch will have flaked almonds and a tiny bit of almond extract in them, so will see how that goes.Massive thanks for this recipe, keep em coming!Linda",

				"Would you recommend using a stand mixer to knead it?",
				"How would this be adapted to dried active yeast? (The Stuff that needs activating for 10 minutes before you use it)?",
				"Hi Ania I made these today and they came out really lovely. I used plain flour only and the inside has come out a little bit doughy maybe slightly undercooked inside. Thank you for inspiring me. Wanted to post a photo but can\u2019t seem to.",

				"Can  ALL  of the flour be bread flour?",
				"I  meant to say, can all the flour be all purpose flour.",
				"Is strong flour the flour type 812? I live in Switzerland and we don't seem to have a flour that's called strong flour. Also, would there be a good substitute for strong flour if I can't find it? :) I just really wanna try this recipe!",
				"Would \"strong flour\" be the same as \"bread flour\" in the U.S.?",
				"Hello Ania, I am French, I am a chef, and I am trying to go vegan. Vegan brioche? Waw, the way you wrote all the recipe, with the pictures etc... Impressive, keep up the work. Will try as soon as possible to make them and give a feed back! A bient\u00f4t, Elodie",
				"I attempted to make these buns, but the dough was so sticky that I couldn't work with it. It more than doubled in size but kind of sunk into a sticky mess when I tried to get it out the bowl to cut into individual buns. The whole lot went in the garbage!  Any suggestions?",
				"I'll eat the 8 pieces in one day for sure, with 8 different spreads!",
				"I'm amazed you've been able to turn brioche vegan! Definitely curious to know what these buns taste like in comparison.",
				"As soon I saw the recipe, I had to try it!  I just can say, easy to make and soooooooooooooo yummy! the 8 pieces disapeared in seconds! Thank you guys for this one."

				"I tried using aquafaba in a cookie recipe, and the cookies were way too cakey for me, with a smooth, silky finish after baking..I did not like it lol..do you think it\u2019s because I whipped it for too long?  Or do cookies always have that texture when using aquafaba?",
				"Hi Ania,I'm very new to plant-based cooking and am really pleased to find your recipes and tips.You say you can whip up the chickpea brine like egg whites - does that mean you can actually cook it like meringue/pavlova?And if you were baking sponge type puddings or cakes, which egg replacement method would you recommend?Thanks for your help. Peggy",
				"Can not wait to try this and share with my sister-in-law and her daughter(my niece) who are both on a plant base diet. Thanks for sharing:)",
				"Your mention of Chickpea brine reminds me of a recipe I happened upon a while back for Chocolate mousse - chickpea water whips up the same as egg whites. And bonus - you can't over whip them!Fold in melted chocolate, chill and bam! chocolate mousse! ... though I am pretty sure this is not the first time you have hear of this :)",
				"Hi Ania,I love your pictures with this post.  I have tried flex egg in the past and ended up with crunchy cookies.  I am hoping the chia egg works better.Stacey",
				"Great work guys. Hope you're well. Looking forward to seeing you again sometime. Will pass this on to Uy\u00ean, my personal masterchef wife. Xo"

				"Thank you so much for this recipe!I was looking for a recipe with beetroot in it, and this went beyond my expectations.I did mine blending raw beetroot instead of roasted, added some ginger sauce and used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon, following the rest of your recipe, and with roasted chickpeas.Oh, dear! It was so glorious in a sandwich with some  cabbage , pesto and avo salad! My mom loved it as well.I've saved some of your recipes for future reference, so far I am in love with your blog, keep it up!The best energies from Venezuela :)"

It turned out great. I was surprised there wasn't any salt in the recipe, so I added a pinch. After sieving, I poured the liquid into my popsicle molds and froze them. I was happy to find another use for the molds. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
