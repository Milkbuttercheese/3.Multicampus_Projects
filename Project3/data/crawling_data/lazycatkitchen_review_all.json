						"1. Place both flours, salt, sugar and instant yeast in a large bowl. Mix well. You can use a standing mixer with a dough hook instead of making it by hand.",
						"2. Add 150 ml (or \u00bd cup + 2 tbsp) of cold plant milk. Mix well with a spoon and then your hands. If the dough is not coming together and there are dry bits, add a touch more plant milk, teaspoon by teaspoon. I used the total of 160 ml (\u00bd cup + 2 tbsp + 2 tsp) of plant milk but the exact amount depends on how absorbent your flour is so go by feel. If using a mixer, add milk gradually while running the mixer on the lowest speed, until the dough comes together.",
						"3. Once the dough has stuck together, turn it out on to a work surface and knead until elastic and smooth \u2013 about 8 minutes by hand or for 3 minutes on a medium setting if using a mixer. This first phase of kneading is important as it allows the gluten to develop before you add fat, which hinders gluten development.",
						"4. Form the dough into a flat disc and pile some of the vegan butter on top of it, close the dough over the butter and start kneading adding more butter cubes as you go along. If using a mixer, add butter gradually while processing on the lowest speed. Occasionally, you may need to scrape the bowl down and reposition the dough.",
						"5. At this point the dough will be very slippery and messy and look like it\u2019s been ruined (see photos). It will come together again, but it needs to be patiently kneaded for about 20-25 minutes if kneading by hand or about 10 minutes if using a mixer.",
						"6. Once the dough has come together again, place in a lightly oiled bowl (oil the top of the dough ball too), cover with cling film and let it proof in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, you can allow it to rise in a warm place until it doubles in size (about 2-3 hrs).",
						"7. Just before you are ready to roll out your dough, melt chocolate and vegan block in a bowl suspended over a pot of barely simmering water. Sift in icing sugar, cocoa powder and salt and fold them in gently until you have a homogenous ganache.",
						"8. Roll the dough out, on a lightly floured surface, until you have a large rectangle measuring approximately 40 cm / 15.5 inches by 35 cm / 13.5 inches.",
						"9. Spread warm chocolate filling on the rolled out dough, leaving a 1.25 cm / 0.5 inch margin all over.",
						"10. Roll the dough into a tight snake along the shortest edge. When you almost finish the roll, paint a bit of water on the bit of dough that has no filling on it and close the roll firmly (that\u2019s important). First rim 2 cm / 1 \u201d off at both ends, then using a sharp knife, cut the snake in half lengthwise.",
						"11. Arrange the two strands of dough so that the cut sides face up. Criss cross one stand over the other in the middle, then twist the two strands again and again until you get a simple braid (see photos in my post).",
						"12. Tuck both ends in slighly and squeeze them with your hands gently so that they are well sealed.",
						"13. Transfer to a baking tin and allow it to proof in a warm place until the dough increases in volume by about 20%  \u2013 it will take about 1 hr.",
						"14. Heat up the oven to 160\u00b0 C / 320\u00b0 F. Bake for about 45 minutes, check up on it after 35 minutes \u2013 if it\u2019s browning too much, cover the top with a piece of kitchen foil and carry on baking.",

If you don\u2019t have a food processor, use a bowl and two knives to cut the fat into the flour (see process photos here).",
						"3. Slowly feed cold water (if using maple syrup use only about 2 tbsp of water mixed in with maple syrup) through the chute while pulsing the mixture. Once the water has been added the pastry should resemble breadcrumbs (see photos in the post).",

If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin.",

						"4. Add in tomato passata, hot sauce (adjust the amount to your heat tolerance), soy sauce, maple syrup, liquid smoke and a generous amount of seasoning. Stir everything together and add 400 ml / 1.5 cup of water.",
						"5. Simmer the mixture gently for about 30 minutes, stirring from time to time, until jackfruit fibres have softened (give them a little squash with a fork to tease apart) and all of the excess moisture has cooked out.",

						"5. Spoon the rest of the white sauce on top of the filled tortillas \u2013 I like to spread it only in the middle so that the edges get nice and crispy \u2013 and sprinkle with shredded cheese, if using.",
						"6. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, until tortillas look crispy and bechamel looks browned in places or (if you used it) cheese looks melted. I like to increase the temperature by 20\u00b0 C / 70\u00b0 F for the last 10-15 minutes if things aren\u2019t browning as much as I would like."

You should end up with delicate curds by the end of this process \u2013 I found that the separation isn\u2019t always as visually apparent as it is with dairy milk and sometimes the milk just looks thick and creamy but that\u2019s okay the resulting cheese is still delicious. Rest the milk for 10 minutes.",

				"15. Keep ready ricotta in an air-tight container in the fridge, for 5-6 days. It can be frozen, but it will release some liquid once defrosted \u2013 simply drain it away and use. It\u2019s perfect spread of toast/crackers, crumbled on top of pasta/gnocchi/risotto or on top of pizza."

						"3. Add canned tomatoes. If using plum tomatoes, add one can at a time, squashing the whole tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Add a can\u2019s worth (about 500 ml / 2 cups) of water to the pan. Stir everything well and allow it to simmer gently for about 20 minutes.",
						"4. Give everything a good stir every 20 minutes (I find that the sauce takes about 60 minutes of simmering time) and squash down any stubborn tomato pieces you see. As soon as the pan is starting to look dry but the tomatoes are still quite chunky, add more water (I add about 1 litre / 4 cups in total).",
						"5. Once all the tomatoes have broken down nicely (see photo) and the sauce is thick and uniform, season with maple syrup, molasses, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, vegan Worcester sauce and blitzed ancho chilli (if using). You will probably need to add quite a bit more salt too \u2013 go by your palate.  Finally, add cooked beans and allow the entire pot to simmer for 10 more minutes or so."

						"1. Soak porcini mushrooms in 400 ml / scant 1\u00be cups of boiling water to soften them and to obtain a mushroom infused stock. I recommend 8 hours at least, 24 hours is even better. If making your own tomato sauce, get it going first (recipe below) and then return to the rolls while it simmers.",
						"2. Chop fresh mushrooms into a small dice. If using a food processor, slice thickly first and use the pulse method. Pulse mushrooms in smaller batches and be very careful not to overprocess, you want coarse dice, not mush.",
						"3. Heat up oil in a large pan you have a lid for. Add diced shallots, fry them off on a low-medium heat until soft and translucent (about 10 minutes). Next add in garlic \u2013 fry for a few minutes stirring frequently as it burns easily.",
						"4. Stir in smoked paprika, a good pinch of salt and pepper and thyme leaves. Stir all the ingredients around for a few seconds on low heat, next add half of the chopped mushrooms. If the water released from the mushrooms does not deglaze the pan, add a splash of wine.",
						"5. Once the first portion of the mushrooms cooks down a little, add the second. Allow it to cook down completely, before adding the rest of the wine, finely chopped porcini (make sure you rinse the grit off first and keep the stock), walnuts, balsamic and soy sauce. Carry on cooking the mushroom mixture until all the excess liquid evaporates. Taste and adjust the seasoning being mindful that rice will dilute the intensity.",
						"6. Next, add in rinsed rice and all of the mushroom stock without the grit that tends to settle at the bottom. Cover the pot and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, once it starts to simmer count about 10 minutes, then switch off the heat and keep the lid on the pan for a further 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.",
						"7. Remove the leaves of the cabbage by making a delicate incision at the bottom of each leaf (where it attaches to the head), prising the leaf off gently. You will need about 14 whole leaves in total. I used large and medium leaves from 2 cabbage heads and kept the rest for a stir-fry or soup.",
						"8. Bring a big pot of water to the boil and grab a large bowl, fill it with cold water (ice cubes help but are not necessary).",

						"10. Thin the outside stem of each leaf with a sharp knife (see photos). Run the knife along the stem trimming off any excess that jets out above the leaf\u2019s surface.",
						"11. Set the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F and grab a large oven proof dish / saucepan, ideally with a fitting lid but you can also use a piece of kitchen foil.",
						"12. Pour 480 ml / 2 cups of tomato sauce and 240 ml / 1 cup of water to the bottom of the dish. Mix the two together.",
						"13. Place a trimmed cabbage leaf on the work bench so that the inside faces you. Place a tablespoon or two (depending on the size of the leaf) of the filling at the bottom of each leaf, fold the sides to the middle and then roll the leaf gently until the filling is safely enclosed inside. Place it snugly in the prepared baking dish, with the seam down. Continue with the remaining leaves in the same manner.",
						"14. Cover the pot with a lid and bake for about 20 minutes.",
						"15. Remove the lid and bake for a further 20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the cabbage leaves are fully cooked through (a sharp knife should slide right through the thickest part of the leaf). If you want the cabbage leaves charred, switch the oven to the grill function for the last 10 minutes (or so) and brush the leaves lightly with olive oil \u2013 watch carefully as they can burn quickly."

						"2. Cut onion into quarters leave the bottom intact. Coat in 1 tsp (5 ml) of oil and 2 tsp (10 ml) of balsamic vinegar and place next to the squash. While you want the squash spread out as much as possible, ensure that the onion pieces are bunched together so that they don\u2019t dry out too much.",

If you don\u2019t have a tin the right size, do not worry, use a large baking tray \u2013 this pie is pretty self-contained.",

						"5. Brush the entire area with a little bit of oil again before arranging the filling on top. I placed a row of pumpkin, followed by cheese and dollops of balsamic onions here and there for pops of flavour.",
						"6. Put a long snake of filling along the longer edge of the pastry leaving a 5 cm / 2\u2033 margin at the bottom. Try to make the filling amount the same everywhere. I ended up using 6 double sheets so I used half of the filling on the first 3 double sheets and the remainder for the remaining 3 double sheets.",
						"7. Starting from the bottom, gently roll the pastry into a long, slightly loose snake. Gently coil the snake and place in the greased baking tin, seam down.",

						"10. Brush the pastry with some more olive oil and sprinkle with seeds for garnish.",
						"11. Bake for approximately 45 minutes, until golden brown. Allow the pie to \u2018set\u2019 after baking before cutting into it. This pie is best eaten fresh but if you want to reheat it, it is best to reheat individual coils at 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F for 10 minutes or so."

MORE INVOLVED METHOD: If whipping aquafaba, place 45 ml / 3 tbsp of aquafaba, a pinch of salt and lemon / lime juice in a spotlessly clean glass or metal bowl (even the tiniest grease residue will inhibit the aquafaba from reaching stiff peaks). Whip the aquafaba with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form \u2013 you need to be able to invert the bowl over your head and the mixture should not move at all. Gently fold in a portion of whipped aquafaba into the dry mixture and then fold in more (you may not need all of it so) in together with vanilla extract and orange blossom water. You should end up with thick, playdough like dough.",
				"5. Form the mixture into balls (I made fifteen 25 g / \u00be oz balls) and roll them in the icing sugar.",
				"6. Place the cookie balls on the prepared baking tray, making sure you leave enough space between them.",
				"7. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the tops are cracked in places. Allow them to cool completely before removing from the tray \u2013 they will crisp up as they cool.",
				"8. Store them in an airtight jar for up to 5 days."

						"8. If pan frying, allow pierogi to go completely cold first (storing them overnight in the fridge is ideal). Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a cast iron skillet (or a non-stick pan), lay cold pierogi on the pan and leave undisturbed for about 5 minutes. Allow them to blister on one side before flipping them to the other side and frying until browned and crisped up.",

Corn is sweet so I didn\u2019t feel the need to add any sweet seasoning but if you do, a touch of mirin will work well. If you wanted the ramen extra indulgent, you can whisk in a tablespoon of cashew or almond butter* in at the end.",

Mix it all with a spoon until it roughly sticks together \u2013 add a touch more water if the dough is too dry to gather all of the flour in the bowl, but do it carefully. If you are not using yoghurt, your dough will require extra water for sure.",

Brush the other side with a small amount of olive oil and turn the parcel over and weight it down with a smaller pan. Cook for a few minutes until the dough is cooked all the way through.

				"3. Pour the liquids into the flours and mix with a spoon to combine roughly. Be aware that if you make any changes to the types of flours (or their ratios) used, you may need to adjust the amount of liquid a little. Also, your brand of flour may be slightly more or less absorbent than mine so be prepared to add (or hold back) a touch more liquid.",
				"4. When the dough starts looking scraggly and mostly stuck together, turn it out on to a work surface. If it feels dry, add a touch more water. The dough should not be too sticky and quite easy to work with.",
				"5. Knead the dough by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out by sliding the heel of the other hand into it. Reform the dough, rotate it a few degrees and start again. Repeat this for about 8-10 minutes, until the dough is elastic and smooth.",
				"6. Put the dough in a large clean bowl and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside, in a warm place for 1-1\u00bd hours, until the dough doubles in size. A very low (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) oven works well too.",
				"7. While the dough is proofing, cut out eight or ten 10 cm / 4\u2033 squares of baking paper, one for each bun.",
				"8. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 8-10 identical portions \u2013 depending how big you want your roll. I made 10 and each roll was 84 g / 2.95 oz.",

				"11. Just before the second proofing is finished, put a large pot (20 cm / 8\u2033 dia is ideal) filled with 1 L / 4 cups of water and baking soda to the boil. Allow the mixture to come to a gentle simmer but keep an eye on it as it has a tendency to boil over.",
				"12. Meanwhile, heat up the oven to 225\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F.",
				"13. One by one, lift each roll on its paper square off the tray. Flip the ball in your hand very gently so that the seam is at the top. Be very gentle as you don\u2019t want to knock any of the air out of the buns at this stage.",
				"14. Go around the perimeter of each ball and pinch the surface of the dough very gently between your thumb and index finger creating a seal in the middle of the bottom. This step helps the buns keep their shape during simmering.",
				"15. Place 2-3 (depending on the size of your pot) buns in the simmering baking soda solution. Allow them to simmer gently (low heat, small bubbles are preferable) for 60 seconds, then flip them gently to the other side using a large spoon. Simmer on the other side for a further 60 seconds. Fish them out and place them on a drying rack. Carry on with the remaining dough balls.",
				"16. Once the buns are completely dry, use a razor or a very sharp knife to make a shallow criss-cross incision at the top of each roll and sprinkle with salt (or sesame or poppy seeds).",
				"17. Bake for about 17-19 minutes, depending on the size of the buns. Consume on the day \u2013 they don\u2019t keep that well."

If you prefer it to be smooth and creamy, use a food processor.",

Finally trickle a bit of hot water (I used 90 ml / 6 tbsp) to the walnuts while processing / crushing them by hand and a touch of walnut oil (you can use olive oil or skip) to make the filling less crumbly.",

						"7. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 6-7 identical portions.",
						"8. Roll each portion into a ball, place them in a lightly oiled baking tray and cover with a kitchen towel. Set aside for about 30-45 minutes, until the balls rise again slightly.",
						"9. Heat up the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.",
						"10. Flatten each ball with your hand then press a lightly oiled glass bottom into each ball to create a deep indent for the filling. If the dough springs back (which it should), use your fingers to perfect the shape of the indent. Fill with the sweet \u2018cheese\u2019 mixture you\u2019ve made earlier and top with berries.",
						"11. Brush the dough (not the filling) with a mixture of plant milk and maple syrup. Bake for about 20 minutes. Brush with a little maple syrup (or sugar syrup) while still hot for that bakery shine."

Roll each piece into a  small ball, flatten with your palm and then using a straight rolling pin, roll each disc into a thin wrapper. Ideally, you want the edges thinner than the middle following a \u2018roll and turn\u2019 technique (see this video).\nPlace a heaped teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of the wrapper and seal the dough over the filling at the top. You can simple fold them into half-moons or use a more intricate pleating pattern. I found this video helpful.\nArrange the finished dumplings, seam up, on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.\nHeat up a little (I used 10 ml / 2 tsp per 10 dumplings) oil in a large frying pan that you have a lid for. Choose a reliable non-sticking pan \u2013 I use a stainless steel pan and it works well. Once the oil is hot, arrange as many potstickers as you can without them touching each other. Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add a splash of water to the pan (1 cm) and put the lid on. Let the dumplings cook in their own steam for about 6-8 minutes \u2013 depending on how thin your dough is. Once all the water has cooked out, take the lid off and leave the potstickers on heat for another minute or two so that any excess water evaporates and the bottoms turn nice and crispy.\nArrange cooked potstickers with crispy bottoms up while you cook the remaining batches.\nServe with a drizzle of chilli oil mixed with in with a small amount of soy sauce or tamari."

Once the water boils, decrease the heat to low-medium and let the quinoa simmer until all the water has been absorbed. To check, tilt the pot slightly, keeping the lid firmly on. If you see no water seeping out from under the grain, switch off the heat and let the quinoa sit (with the lid firmly on) for another 5-10 min to finish off cooking in its own steam. Cool it down completely.",

Brush zucchini slices with olive oil on both sides, season and arrange on the same tray. Coat asparagus spears in 1 tsp of oil, season and place on the baking tray. Roast for about 8 minutes, take the asparagus off the tray if ready, carry on roasting broccoli and zucchini for another 5-7 minutes, until cooked through. Alternatively, you could use a griddle pan if you prefer.",
				"4. STEAM: Bring a large pot of water to the boil and grab a steaming basket. Once the water comes to the boil, steam broccoli for about 5-6 minutes, zucchini slices for about 3 minutes, asparagus for about 3-5 minutes and peas for about 3 minutes. You will need to do the steaming in batches.",
				"5. If you roasted your vegetables, bring a small pot of water to the boil, cook frozen petit pois or peas for about 3 minutes, drain and immediately refresh it under a cold tap to preserve the colour.",
				"6. Heat up 1 tsp of oil in a small frying pan, once warm add almonds. Toast them for a few minutes until golden and slightly plump, moving them around the pan frequently. Sprinkle with flaky salt before removing from the pan. Allow to cool down and chop roughly.",
				"7. Put all the dressing ingredients in a small blender (I used Ninja blender for this). Make sure the lemon flesh does not include the bitter pith. Blend until smooth, adjust seasoning to taste.",
				"8. Arrange all of the salad elements on a large platter, dress with approximately half of the dressing (keep the rest in the fridge, use up in the next few days) and sprinkle with toasted almonds at the end. Pieces of soft vegan cheese, like this almond feta, scattered on top are also a nice addition."

						"1. Sift flour, xantham gum (if using GF flour mix) and baking powder into a large bowl. The sifting is not strictly speaking necessary, but it helps to get lighter scones.",
						"2. Add sugar, salt and ground ginger (if using) and mix well.",
						"3. Chop coconut oil small and add it to the flour. Using two knifes cut it into the flour until there are no big chunks.",
						"4. Next, use your fingertips to rub coconut oil into the flour until the flour looks pebbly. Do not rush this step or take shortcuts if you are after light, nicely risen scones.",
						"5. Next add in extra ginger (if using, see NOTES), orange zest and very finely chopped stem or crystallized ginger. Mix everything well.",
						"6. Start adding plant milk slowly while bringing the dough together. Start off using a spoon and then just use your hands. Do not handle the dough too much, just until it\u2019s combined and stays together \u2013 do not worry about it being very smooth.",
						"7. Place the dough in the fridge for 15-20 minutes (no longer than that as the baking powder will lose its fizz) while you increase the the oven temperature to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F (or 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F with fan) and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"8. After the dough has had a chance to rest, roll it out on a lightly floured surface. Keep the dough thick (2 cm / \u00be\u201d) for fluffy scones.",
						"9. Use a fluted cookie cutter that is 5 cm / 2\u2033 in diameter and cut circles out of the dough. Do not twist the cutter as that inhibits rising, simply apply a lot of pressure to the cutter and then lift the cutter with the scone inside. Place over the baking tray and gently pop the scone out onto the tray. I found that dipping the cutter in flour and then shaking the excess off helps a lot when it comes to releasing the scones onto the tray.",
						"10. Bring any dough leftovers very gently into a ball and cut out some more \u2013 they won\u2019t be as good as the first batch, but if you handle the dough super gently, they will still be very tasty.",
						"11. Place the scones on the prepared baking tray, making sure there is some space around each one. Mix all the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl and glaze the tops of the scones with a pastry brush.",
						"12. Sprinkle each scone with some sugar (if using) and bake for 12-15 minutes. My oven heats the right hand side more than the left so after 12 minutes the ones on the right were done, but the other ones needed another 3 minutes. I rotated the tray before baking them for the last 3 minutes so that they were evenly browned on all sides.",
						"13. Let the scones cool down a little before cutting them in half with a serrated knife and filling them with coconut yoghurt and roasted rhubarb."

						"1. Rinse dried shiitake and cover with boiling water (weigh the shiitake down or else they will float) to soften. Keep immersed in water for as long as possible. I tend to use rehydrated mushrooms leftover from a mushroom stock.",

						"3. Cut off stems from rehydrated shiitake and discard them, slice the caps and add to the food processor together with all the remaining ingredients \u2013 if baking your meatballs use only 15 g / \u00bc cup breadcrumbs. I recommend not adding chickpeas yet and processing them separately to retain a bit of texture (but that\u2019s optional).",
						"4. Process the mushroom mixture until everything is well chopped, transfer to a large mixing bowl.",
						"5. If you haven\u2019t already, add your chickpeas to the food processor and pulse a few times until processed but there is a bit of texture left.",
						"6. Add chickpeas to the mushroom mixture and incorporate them together well with your hands.",
						"7. Squeeze portions of the mixture in your palm to make it stick to itself and then roll into balls (mine were 20 g / \u00be oz each) in your hands.",
						"8. Chill the meatballs in the fridge for a few hours (overnight is best if you have time), especially if frying them.",
						"9. FRYING: Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a heavy skillet or pan and once the oil is hot, arrange chilled meatballs in a circle in a clockwise fashion. Give them a minute or two on one side, lift gently and fry on the other size until browned and crispy on the outside.",
						"10. BAKING: Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F. Brush a little bit of oil under each meatball and brush the tops with a little oil also. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them once halfway through. Use a flat spatula to gently prise them off the tray if they stick."

						"5. Season with dried herbs, salt and pepper and a pinch of chilli flakes if you enjoy a little heat.",

The mixture will be very wet at this stage so handle it gently, but don\u2019t be tempted to add more flour \u2013 it will make falafels dry. Apply some sesame seeds to the underside of each falafel with your hand before placing it on the oiled area of your baking paper. Sprinkle the top with more sesame seeds.",
				"7. Bake for 12 minutes. Take the tray out of the oven, gently lift each falafel off the surface using a spatula. Brush a little oil on before placing the other side of the falafels down. Brush the tops with some more olive oil for extra crispiness and bake for another 12-13 minutes until the tops are golden brown."

If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 2 tbsp / 30 ml, but you may need a little more. Mix the water into the flour with a knife and then check with your hand that no more water is needed \u2013 the dough should clump together easily but should not feel wet. If it\u2019s too dry, add a tiny amount (one tsp at a time) more water, mix and check again.",

						"6. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",
						"7. Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.",
						"8. 45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line the pastry case with a large piece of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.",

						"2. Finally, gently fold in the almond meal, orange zest, cardamom, baking powder, vanilla extract and orange blossom water (if using). You should end up with a very thick batter (it will be a bit less thick if you used maple syrup instead of sugar).",
						"3. Fill the pre-baked (and cooled off) pastry case with a layer of cranberry jam / jelly.",

						"5. Decorate the top with cranberries, placing them on top of the filling and pushing them only a tiny bit as the filling will rise during baking.",

Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

						"4. Finally add in ice cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife to distribute the water evenly. The exact amount of water needed depends on the absorbency of your flour but start off with 15-30 ml / 1-2 tbsp and add a tiny bit more at a time, if needed \u2013 too much water makes more a tough pastry.",
						"5. To check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a little more water, mix it in and check again.",
						"6. Once the dough is the right consistency, form it into a flattened ball quickly \u2013 handle the dough as little as possible, wrap it in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.",
						"7. Just before you are ready to work on the dough, preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F.",
						"8. Remove the dough from the fridge and divide it into 4 equal sized pieces. Work on one piece at a time keeping the rest in the fridge. Flatten the dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Use very light pressure at first and progressively roll the dough 2 mm thick.",
						"9. I used these mini tart cases so I used 8 cm / 3.15\u2033 round cookie cutters to make the circles of dough to line the moulds with. Once I lined them with pastry, I trimmed them to size using a sharp knife. You could also make them in a standard 12-hole muffin tin. If that\u2019s what you have, use a large cookie cutter (I used my biggest 10 cm / 4\u2033 circle) to cut a neat circle out of the pastry and line the muffin hole with it.",
						"10. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the edges and making sure there is no air bubble underneath the pastry. The pastry won\u2019t quite reach the top of the muffin hole but that\u2019s okay. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",

						"3. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and allow it to bubble gently for 5-10 minutes, stirring the whole time.",

						"3. They taste best still slightly warm. Cool the pies completely before storing and keep in an air-tight container, they will keep for about 2-3 days. If you want to make these in advance, I would advise freezing raw pastry cases in their moulds and freezing the mince pie filling separately and baking them on the day \u2013 bear in mind that freezing tends to dull flavours so you may want to over season your mince pie filling a touch."

To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there is enough moisture in this recipe not to have to use any more liquid, which means you\u2019ll end up with a smooth, creamy and thick frosting.",
						"4. The mixture will thicken a little after it\u2019s been well refrigerated but to be able to pipe it, I recommend adding agar agar as a firming agent. Activate agar agar according to the instructions on the packet. I recommend using powder as it\u2019s 3 times more potent than flakes and easier to activate \u2013 you need to rehydrate it in liquid (almond milk in this case) for 10-15 minutes first before bringing to the boil. Flakes need a lot of simmering and I found that they never fully dissolve.",
						"5. Once activated, add agar agar to the frosting and blend well and then give it another blend before putting it into the piping bag so that you break any lumps. I like to transfer it to a bowl and give it a really good whisk with a wire whisk to make sure the icing is smooth before I put it into my piping bag."

They are done when lightly golden and cracked in places and fragrant. Alternatively, you can roast them in a 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F oven but be aware that this works better for larger quantities or else they burn rather quickly. I tend to roast at least 2 cups of seeds at a time for about 8-10 minutes. Allow them to cool down completely before blending in the pesto.",
						"2. Grind the pumpkin seeds first, then add all the remaining ingredients apart from olive oil and salt and blitz well. I used 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup of lemon juice in my pesto, as I like a bit of lemon flavour but please adjust the amount to your taste. Once everything is minced well, start adding olive oil. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste (I used approximately 1 tsp in total).",

						"3. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, take one quarter of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out as thin as you can (2-3 mm), the thinner the dough the tastier the ravioli. You can obviously use a pasta machine to roll out your dough if you have one (I don\u2019t).",
						"4. Place one pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface, use a glass or a cookie cutter (I used 7 cm / 2.75\u2033 diameter one) to cut out circles. Make small blobs (\u00bd tsp as it\u2019s important not to overfill) of filling in the middle of each circle.

Slowly and very gradually trickle in some ice cold water, incorporating it into the flour using a fork. Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I used 45 ml / 3 tbsp of water, but please go through the process I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flour brands have different absorbency levels.",

You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.",

Trim the excess with a sharp knife and then go over the edge and tidy it up with your finger tips. Proceed in the same manner with the remaining cases. Use the cutoffs from the first 8 cases to cover the remaining 2 so that you have 10 custard tart cases in total.",

Otherwise a piece of greaseproof paper also works, not as well as it tends to absorb some of the moisture out of the tortillas and its surface gets a bit crumpled in the process, but it does work.

As a rule of thumb, cook each tortilla for 2-3 minutes in total and while it\u2019s tempting to get it nicely charred, don\u2019t push it too much as your tortillas will end up dry and brittle.",
						"8. Once off the pan, place the cooked tortillas in a tortilla warmer (or your homemade equivalent). They will soften from the steam and remain warm and supple.",

						"7. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking tin. While it is really tempting to stick a few extra blueberries into the surface of the cake, they will cause the cake to crack and possibly overflow so I don\u2019t recommend it. If you want to make the cake look good and are not planning to top with yoghurt as per my suggestion in step 10, a handful (not too much as you still want to have some cake surface exposed to absorb lemon syrup) of slivered or flaked almonds on top will look nice.",
						"8. Bake for about 40-45 min, until a toothpick comes out clean and the top is nicely browned.",
						"9. Once cool, soak with hot (that\u2019s important) lemon syrup \u2013 it will give the cake a lemony flavour and provide extra moistness.",

If you are making the COCONUT VERSION whisk all of the ingredients (apart from sugar if that\u2019s what you choose to sweeten it with) together in a bowl using a wire whisk.",

				"6. As I wanted to prettify this dessert for the blog, I mashed up some extra raspberries and placed a thin layer of them at the bottom of each glass, but be aware that the extra moisture makes the mousse a little less firmly set where it comes in contact with the raspberries. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of an issue, but I want you to be aware.",
				"7. Fold stiff aquafaba into the raspberry mixture gently and gradually (I do it in 3-4 batches) until the two are well incorporated. Use a slow folding motion so that you don\u2019t knock too much air out of the dessert when mixing. The mixture will deflate a little bit, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal. Pour the mixture between 4 small glasses and place them in the fridge for 8 hours (or overnight) for the mousse to set.",
				"8. Once the mousse has had a chance to set, decorate with fresh raspberries just before serving. This dessert keeps in an airtight container for about 2 days."

To check for large lumps, shake the bowl \u2013 it will bring large bits of oil to the surface.",
						"3. While you can do this step in the food processor, I strongly suggest you transfer the mixture to a large bowl at this point and do this manually as then you have a greater amount of control. Slowly and very gradually trickle in some ice cold water, incorporating it into the flour using a fork. Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I ended up using just short of 105 ml / 7 tbsp of water, but please go through the process as I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flour brands have different absorbency levels.",
						"4. Empty your bowl (or a food processor bowl) onto a work surface and bring all the dough together using your hands, but do not knead if you are working with gluten flour (overworking the dough will make the pastry tough). Form the dough into a flattened disc, wrap it up in cling film and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the ricotta filling (see below).",
						"5. After the dough has had a chance to rest, cut 1/3 of it and set it aside. Gently and slowly roll 2/3 of the dough out on a lightly floured surface. You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier (I did) to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.",
						"6. Roll the dough into a large circle 2 cm / 1\u2033 bigger than the tart case (I used a 25 cm / 10\u2033 diameter tart case). Roll the dough sheet over the rolling pin, place the rolling pin over the case and unroll it gently. Line the case making sure the dough fits into the case snugly, do not trim the excess just yet as it helps to have it when attaching the lattice top.",
						"7. About 30 minutes before you are ready to bake your vegan crostata, place a pizza stone (ideally, if you have one) or a well conducting metal tray in the oven and heat the oven up to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F (160\u00b0 C / 320\u00b0 F fan forced). Placing the crostata on a hot pizza stone / well heated metal tray prevents the bottom from being soggy.",
						"8. Spread the jam evenly on the bottom of the tart case. Followed by the \u2018ricotta\u2019 mixture\u2019.",
						"9. Roll the remaining portion of the dough into another large circle and using a sharp knife or a dough cutter, cut it into long strips. Criss-cross the strips over the pie attaching them into the overhanging crust, trim the excess crust with a knife.",
						"10. Brush the pastry generously with vegan \u2018eggwash\u2019.",
						"11. Place crostata in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheesecake is set. Allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting although I find that it cuts much neater when cooled completely.",
						"12. Optionally, you may want to dust the cooled tart with a little icing sugar."

						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, psyllium husk powder (if making GF version) and salt. Make a well in the centre and add olive oil, vegan yoghurt and water. I found that the gluten-free version needed more water (about 160 ml / 2/3 cup) but please use your judgement as every flour and flour mix has a slightly different absorbency level so the exact water amount may vary. It\u2019s better to start off with less water and add more if needed later. Mix it all with a spoon until it roughly sticks together \u2013 add a touch more water if the dough is too dry to gather all of the flour in the bowl, but do it carefully. If you are not using yoghurt, your dough will require extra water for sure.",
						"2. Empty the dough on to the counter. Knead gluten dough for at least 5 mins and then set aside for 30 minutes under a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up. GF version does not need kneading as such but you want to make sure the dough is smooth and homogeneous before you allow it to rest."
					]
				},
				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, divide it into 4 equal size portions. Take a portion of the dough and roll it out into a large rectangle or oval. Roll the dough as thinly as you can (1 mm is ideal) \u2013 that\u2019s important as you don\u2019t want the seams that result from making your gozleme parcel to be thick and doughy.",
						"2. Designate a space in the middle of your dough and arrange a thin layer of dry spinach mixture there, a few dollops of vegan feta on top and some more spinach to cover the feta \u2013 be careful not to overfill the parcel though. Cut the very edges of the dough off to ensure the seams aren\u2019t thick and unpleasant to eat and fold the sides over the spinach rectangle like a parcel (being careful not to trap too much air inside). Seal and roll over the parcel very gently with a rolling pin to seal all of the seams.",
						"3. Proceed in the same manner with the remaining 3 pieces of dough.",
						"4. Heat up a non-stick or griddle pan over a medium-low heat. Brush the first parcel with a little oil and place it, seam side down, on a pre-heated pan. Allow it to cook undisturbed for a few minutes until the pastry is cooked and nicely blistered. Brush the other side with a small amount of olive oil and turn the parcel over, again cook for a few minutes until the dough is just cooked. Proceed like this with the remaining 3 parcels.",
						"5. Allow it to cool just a little and then enjoy straightaway, with a squeeze of lemon of you wish."

					"FILLING": [
						"1. Place all the filling ingredients (apart from almond flour or breadcrumbs) in a food processor. Process until smooth. Adjust seasoning to taste.",
						"2. Add enough almond flour (or breadcrumbs). I found that 25 g / \u00bc cup almond flour is enough \u2013 you may need even less, if you are using breadcrumbs."
					]
				},
				{
					"DOUGH": [
						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and turmeric (if using). Make a well in the centre and add olive oil and aquafaba. Mix it all with a spoon until it roughly sticks together. You may need to add a touch more aquafaba if the dough is too dry, if too wet, add a bit more flour.",
						"2. Knead the dough for at least 5 mins and then set aside for 30-60 minutes under a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"3. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, take a portion of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out as thin as you can (2-3 mm), the thinner the dough the tastier the ravioli. You can obviously use a pasta machine to roll out your dough if you have one (I don\u2019t). Cut the sheet in half \u2013 you will need two matching pasta sheets to form the top and bottom side of your ravioli.",
						"4. I used a ravioli mould (like this) but you can also just make them by hand, using a knife, pasta stamp or a cookie cutter instead. Place one pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface. Make small blobs of filling in neat rows leaving plenty of space around each blob so that each raviolo can be comfortably sealed. Place second pasta sheet on top, draping it over the blobs of filling. Press the pasta around each filling down with cupping hands to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or a pasta crimper. Double check each raviolo is sealed well.",
						"5. Put the finished ravioli on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you have used up all the dough and / or all the filling.",
						"6. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water boils, place a few ravioli (do not overcrowd the pot) in the boiling water and cook, on a rolling boil, for about 5 minutes. After the time is up, fish cooked ravioli out with a slotted spoon, shaking excess water off gently, and place them on a plate. Cook all the remaining ravioli in this way.",
						"7. To serve, baste them in olive oil, wild garlic pesto or make a simple creamy pasta sauce instead."

You should get approximately 1 litre / 4 cups of stock at this point \u2013 top up with more water if necessary. Return strained stock to the pot and whisk sweet potato / garlic / soy milk mixture in and finely grated garlic clove to add a bit of brightness to the soup. Warm up.",

						"1. Mix flour, sugar, salt and instant yeast in a large mixing bowl. If using maple syrup do not add it yet.",
						"2. Stir in warmed up plant milk. If using maple syrup (or other liquid sweetener), use 60 ml / \u00bc cup less plant milk and add maple syrup to the milk before adding to the dry ingredients.",
						"3. Stir everything together with a large wooden spoon. You may need to add a tablespoon or so more milk if the mixture is too dry to stick together roughly at this point but do so very gradually. When the mixture has mostly stuck together turn the mixture out on to a work surface or bread\u00a0board.",
						"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. You then reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Halfway through the kneading incorporate coconut oil (solid not melted) into the dough. It will make the dough slippery at first, you might think it has been ruined \u2013 but it has not, it will make for a richer dough. Keep on kneading and the dough will become elastic and smooth soon. In total the kneading should take about 15 minutes for this amount of dough.",
						"5. When the dough is smooth, form it into a ball and coat in a thin layer of oil. Place in a large mixing bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave it in a warm place (but not too warm!) until it has doubled in size \u2013 about 1 hr. It\u2019s a good idea to take a photo of the dough at the beginning so that you are sure when it has doubled in volume. While the dough is proofing, make the filling (see FILLING section below).",
						"6. Once the dough has doubled in size, empty it out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.",
						"7. Roll the dough into a large rectangle that is about 36 cm / 14\u2033 wide. The height depends how swirly you want the buns, the thinner the dough the more swirls and therefore filling your buns will end up with \u2013 40 cm / 15\u00be\u201d height is what mine was.",
						"8. Spread a thin layer (you don\u2019t want the buns to end up soggy) of blended rhubarb all over the rolled out dough. Sprinkle evenly (!) with finely chopped candied ginger and raw rhubarb slices making sure they land on their sides for the most part.",
						"9. Starting from the bottom, roll the dough tightly so that you end up with a 36 cm / 14\u2033 long \u201cdough snake\u201d.",
						"10. Now, depending on your baking dish, divide the dough into 9 or 12 even (4-3 cm / 1.5 \u2013 1.1\u2033) segments. I find that a square or round dish, like mine, needs 9 and a rectangular one needs 12 pieces. Use a long piece of sewing thread to do the cutting as it does not squash the filling as much as a knife does. Place the thread under the snake and overlap the thread on the top of the snake where you want the cut to be, pull tight to cut.",
						"11. Place the segments, swirls face up, on a lightly oiled baking dish, leaving 1-2 cm between each bun. If you can fill the baking tray, this is ideal.",
						"12. Leave the buns (covered with a kitchen towel) to prove again for another hour. Toward the end of this time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F.",
						"13. Brush the buns with the maple syrup + plant milk glaze and bake them for about 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Cover the top with a piece of kitchen foil if you find that they are browning too quickly.",
						"14. While the buns are baking, create the icing by combining a tablespoon or so of the rhubarb puree with icing sugar and mixing really well. Adding more rhubarb puree will make the icing pinker but it will set a little looser.\nTake the buns out of the oven when they are lovely and golden, and brush them with maple syrup (or sugar syrup) while they are still hot.\nOnce they are cool, drizzle the rhubarb icing on top.",

I used 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup of lemon juice in my pesto, as I like things to be lemony, so you may want to adjust the amount to your taste. Once everything is minced well, start trickling in olive oil while the motor is going. Taste and add salt to taste \u2013 if using capers, you will only need a touch, otherwise more like 1 tsp.",

				"3. Stir all the spices (add salt later) into the aromatics and add chopped fresh and rehydrated shiitake mushrooms (discard their wooden stems). Allow the mushrooms to cook down completely so that all the liquid evaporates.",
				"4. Add salt and soy sauce / tamari. Mix all really well, allow any further liquid (salt makes mushrooms release moisture) evaporate and then stir uncooked rice through. Mix well and set aside.",
				"5. Remove the leaves of the cabbage by making a delicate incision at the bottom of each leaf (where it attaches to the head), prising the leaf off gently. You will need about 14 whole leaves in total.",

Place a heaped tablespoon (do not overfill as rice needs room for expansion) of the filling at the bottom of each leaf, fold the sides to the middle and then roll the leaf gently (not too tightly) until the filling is safely enclosed inside. Place it snugly in the prepared baking dish, the seam down. Continue with the remaining leaves in the same manner.",

You can use a baking tray, but not one that gets misshapen in high heat or else all the juices will run to one corner and burn (I know from experience \ud83d\ude1b ).",

Use a fork to ensure the mixture is spread fairly evenly and it goes all the way to the edges \u2013 make sure the mixture is piled up loosely \u2013 this way it will cook all the way through and the hash browns won\u2019t be tough. If you would rather freestyle, that\u2019s fine too \u2013 use a spoon, don\u2019t flatten the mixture too much and tidy the edges up with a knife to avoid them getting burnt.",

Bake for a further 15-20 minutes (raw potato hash browns) and 10-15 minutes (parboiled potato hash browns).",

You will place your filling in the horizontal middle of the pastry. The width of the area designated for the filling is determined by the width of your butternut squash (mine was 8 cm / 3\u2033 wide).",
						"2. Mould some of the filling in a rectangle.",
						"3. Place the two halves of the butternut squash on top of the filling so that the cut ends touch each other in the centre \u2013 you may need to trim them so that they aren\u2019t longer than the filling area.",
						"4. Mould the rest of the filling over the butternut squash using your hands, making sure you compact the filling as you go along.",
						"5. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm / 1\u2033 diagonal incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack to be able to create a braid at the top. See photos and video under this post for more details.",
						"6. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. This method works great here as it prevents slack in the pastry and allows for tight wrapping despite the slightly irregular shape of the filling. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevents the vegetarian Wellington from bursting while in the oven.",
						"7. Brush the pastry with soy milk.",
						"8. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden. Serve with gravy and your favourite sides."

I have simply rolled it out as much as I could using a rolling pin and then placed it on a clean kitchen towel (which is handy to help you roll the strudel later) and gently stretched the dough using my hands, remembering not to pull too much in one direction at once. The thinner the dough the better but if you are a beginner, don\u2019t worry, do the best you can! If you get any small tears, patch them up quickly.",
						"8. Go round your dough and cut off thick edges with a sharp knife as you don\u2019t want thick lumps of pastry anywhere in a strudel. Brush the entire sheet with a little oil and generously sprinkle with toasted breadcrumbs.",
						"9. Decide where your filling is going to go, taking into account the size of your baking tray.

Heat up a large pan with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add sliced fresh mushrooms onto the hot oil and leave undisturbed for a minute or two so that they caramelise on one side. Stir the pan and again leave them to caramelise for a bit. Give them a stir from time to time until they are mostly caramelised and look cooked. Add a finely grated garlic clove, thyme leaves and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Stir well, allowing the garlic to cook gently in the mushrooms.\nKeep on adding the stock to the rice until the rice is almost al dente \u2013 i.e. has a small amount of bite to it when tasted. It will take about 15-20 minutes from the moment you first started adding liquid to the pan.\nTaste a grain of rice to make sure it is almost ready. If it is, stir some porcini cream (if using) and a bit of balsamic vinegar if you like a touch of acidity to break through the creaminess.

				"11. While you make your risotto, you may want make a bit of porcini cream to fold into the risotto at the last minute to make it more indulgent. Blend soaked and drained cashews with about 20 g / 7 oz of soaked porcini and a splash of water in a blender until super smooth.",
				"12. When the risotto is nearly done, it\u2019s time to pan-fry the fresh mushrooms \u2013 you may need to do them in batches as overcrowding the pan will produce soggier mushrooms. Heat up a large pan with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add sliced fresh mushrooms onto the hot oil and leave undisturbed for a minute or two so that they caramelise on one side. Stir the pan and again leave them to caramelise for a bit. Give them a stir from time to time until they are mostly caramelised and look cooked. Add a finely grated garlic clove, thyme leaves and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Stir well, allowing the garlic to cook gently in the mushrooms.",
				"13. Keep on adding the stock to the rice until the rice is almost al dente \u2013 i.e. has a small amount of bite to it when tasted. It will take about 15-20 minutes from the moment you first started adding liquid to the pan.",
				"14. Taste a grain of rice to make sure it is almost ready. If it is, stir some porcini cream (if using) and a bit of balsamic vinegar if you like a touch of acidity to break through the creaminess. Switch the heat off, cover the pan / pot and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes.",

						"1. Mix the flour, salt and xantham gum (if using a gluten-free flour mix instead of an all purpose flour containing gluten) in a large bowl or a food processor.",
						"2. Add chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour using a pastry cutter (or two knives) or pulse in a food processor until you obtain a sandy texture that clumps together when you grab a handful, with no large lumps of fat left. To check for large lumps, shake the bowl or the food processor bowl \u2013 it will bring large bits of oil to the surface.",
						"3. While you can do this step in the food processor, I strongly suggest you transfer the mixture to a large bowl at this point and do this manually as then you have a greater amount of control. Slowly and very gradually trickle in some ice cold water incorporating it into the flour using a fork. Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I ended up using \u00bc cup plus 2 tsp of water, but please go through the process as I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flours have different absorbency levels.",
						"4. Empty your bowl (or a food processor bowl) onto a work surface and bring all the dough together using your hands, but do not knead if you are working with gluten flour (overworking the dough will make the pastry tough). Form the dough into a flattened disc and refrigerate for at least 30-45 minutes.",
						"5. Gently and slowly roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface. You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier (I did) to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.",
						"6. Roll the dough into a large circle 2 cm / 1 inch bigger than the pie dish (I used a 24 cm / 9.5\u2033 diameter pie dish). Roll the dough sheet over the rolling pin, place the rolling pin over the pie dish and unroll it gently. Line the dish and fold any excess you get at the edges under so that you end up with thick edges. Then go over the edge and crimp the edges by interlocking your index and middle finger on one hand against the index finger of your other hand (see photo). Pierce the bottom in several places with a fork.",
						"7. Heat up the oven to 160\u00b0 C / 320\u00b0 F fan forced (180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F no fan) and place your pie in the freezer (or fridge, but freezer is better) for another 15 minutes or so.",

					"DOUGH": [
						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add olive oil. Mix well and add about 240 ml / 1 cup of hot water. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start bringing the dough together with your hands. If after a little bit of kneading the dough isn\u2019t holding together (initially it\u2019s supposed to be a bit dry to the touch but hold together), it may need a bit more hot water. It is very important to add the water in very small amounts\u00a0as too much water will negatively affect the dough. Knead it for about 5-10 minutes with your hands (after kneading, the dough should become very smooth and elastic, but not sticky) and then set aside for 30 minutes under\u00a0a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, grab a portion of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be\u00a0about\u00a01-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough, the tastier the dumplings. With a cookie cutter or an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place a small amount of filling in the centre of each circle, fold the circle in half and press the edges of the semi-circle together with your fingers. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely. Put the finished\u00a0dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a damp kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you\u2019ve used up all of the dough or the filling.",
						"3. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water is boiling, throw\u00a0in 10 dumplings at a time and from the moment the water comes to the boil again cook for 5 minutes (depending on how thick your dough is). Once the time is up, fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Put a new batch in\u00a0until you have cooked\u00a0them all.",
						"4. OPTIONAL STEP: Heat up a little olive oil in a pan and place the cooled-down (they should be cold!) dumplings in the pan. Turn them after they\u2019ve browned on one side. Make sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan and do not turn the dumplings too early as they may start falling apart.",

						"2. Next add in garlic cloves and fry on a gentle heat for a few minutes, stirring the whole time.",
						"3. Add chopped mushrooms into the pan, allow them to fry off for 5-10 minutes, stirring from time to time.",
						"4. Add chopped cabbage, sauerkraut, porcini stock, finely chopped porcini mushrooms, salt, thyme, smoked paprika and a good grind of black pepper.",

The mixture is meant to be very wet. As long as you are able to form patties, there is no need to add more flour as the falafels will end up dry inside. Place in the fridge for several hours (or freezer for an hour) to firm up.",
						"5. Put sesame seeds on a plate. Using your hands, gently form small falafels out of the mixture (mine were 20 g each). Once shaped, dip your hand in sesame seeds and press them into the falafel with your fingers. Do that several times until the falafel is nicely coated on all sides.",

					"GNOCCHI": [
						"1. Set the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F (no fan).",
						"2. Pierce the clean potatoes all over with a skewer or a sharp knife. Place on a baking tray and bake for about 60 minutes (for medium size potatoes), turning to the other side halfway through (be sure to use kitchen gloves or kitchen tongs). They are ready as soon as a sharp knife slides in easily.",
						"3. While the potatoes are baking, prepare your work bench by cleaning it and sprinkling with a generous amount of flour.",
						"4. As soon as the potatoes come out of the oven, cut them in half. Put each half (skin on) into a potato ricer so that the cut side is right against the mesh. Rice the potatoes all over the prepared work bench area, spreading them a little (instead of placing all the flesh in one massive heap) so that more steam can escape as they cool.",
						"5. Once you are done with all the potatoes, you may want to go over the skins with a spoon, scooping the rest of the flesh and ricing it \u2013 I find that there is always a generous layer of potato flesh left.",
						"6. Sprinkle riced potatoes evenly with salt, nutmeg and half of the flour and then using a large knife (a pastry cutter or a bench scraper) cut the flour into the potatoes using a chopping motion.",
						"7. Next use your hands to knead the dough very gently as you do want a uniform dough to form, but you do not want to knead it too much as that will develop gluten in the flour and your gnocchi will be chewy. Keep on adding a little bit of flour at a time until the dough isn\u2019t sticky anymore. The less flour the better (produces lighter gnocchi) but too little flour will make them fall apart in cooking so don\u2019t go crazy. A good guide is about 10-15% flour compared to the weight of uncooked potatoes.",
						"8. Once you have a uniform dough that holds together well yet it is still very pliable, divide it into quarters. Roll each quarter into a long thin snake. Using a knife, cut the snake into same size pieces. Coat them lightly in flour.",
						"9. OPTIONALLY, you may want to ridge your gnocchi using the tines of a fork (or a gnocchi board if you own one), but that part is fairly time consuming, takes a while to get the hang of and it\u2019s not necessary, especially if you intend to serve them simply, in sage and garlic-flavoured olive oil. The idea is that the ridges help the gnocchi to hold more sauce, so if you are serving yours with a rag\u00f9, for example, you may want to spend the extra time. To ridge the gnocchi, roll each piece into a ball and then gently roll it against the back of the fork.",
						"10. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Put a batch (say 20 \u2013 depends on the size of your pot) into the boiling water. Give the water a gentle stir and wait for the gnocchi to resurface (1-2 minutes). As soon as they come to the surface, scoop them up with a slotted spoon. Allow the excess water to drain away over the pot and place on a clean plate. Continue with the rest of your gnocchi.",
						"11. If you like your gnocchi pan-fried, allow them to cool down completely before frying or, even better, store them in the fridge overnight or else they will fall apart and turn into mush. I\u2019ve also tried frying them from raw (i.e. no prior boiling) and it does work but you need to fry them on a low heat and for a longer period of time to make sure the flour inside is fully cooked.",
						"12. To pan-fry your gnocchi, bring a non-stick pan to temperature, cover the bottom of the pan with olive oil, let the oil get hot and then throw cold gnocchi into the oil. Shake the pan to coat the gnocchi in oil and then leave undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms of the gnocchi get caramelised. Toss the pan again and continue in the same manner until the gnocchi is golden on both sides. Serve with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, crushed hazelnuts and fried sage leaves (see below)."

						"2. Add chopped garlic to the sage flavoured oil. Gently cook the garlic for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time, but do not allow it to brown as it will taste bitter. If the garlic is sizzling too aggressively, turn the heat off (or take the pan off the heat if not using gas) and allow it to cook in the residual heat.",
						"3. Add nutritional yeast to the garlicky oil, a good pinch of salt and a splash of gnocchi cooking water and whisk until emulsified. If the sauce is too thin, allow the excess water to cook out until it reaches the desired consistency.",

If the water has evaporated and the tomatoes are still chunky, feel free to add another splash of water and make sure the pan is on a low heat. Traditionally, this sauce is meant to be fairly loose, but I like it a little bit thicker \u2013 adjust the consistency to your own taste.",

				"6. Gently and slowly whisk chocolate until smooth. You may want to add a bit of maple syrup to the mixture at this point. I did not as I feel that caramel provides enough sweetness to this dessert, but it\u2019s down to personal preference. If your chocolate seizes, which happens sometimes, bring it back by whisking in another 1-2 tablespoons of room temperature almond milk. Allow this mixture to cool down a little.",
				"7. While the chocolate is cooling, whisk aquafaba and a few drops of acid (it helps it stiffen) with an electric whisk until you achieve stiff peaks. Aquafaba needs to be so stiff that you should be able to invert the bowl over your head.",
				"8. Gradually (start off with 1/3 of whipped aqauafaba) and gently fold whipped aquafaba into the chocolate mixture until the two are well incorporated. The mixture will deflate a little, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal, but you don\u2019t want it to deflate too much by knocking too much air out of the mixture, which is why a gentle and slow folding motion is key here.",

Using metal tongs or a fork, turn the aubergine every 2-3 minutes so that a new area of skin is exposed to a naked flame with each turn.

				"5. Place the dough in the fridge for 15-20 minutes (no longer than that as the baking powder will lose its fizz) while you heat up the oven to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
				"6. After the dough has had a chance to rest, roll it out on a lightly floured surface. Keep the dough thick (2 cm / 0.75\u2033) for fluffy scones.",
				"7. Use a fluted cookie cutter that is 5 cm / 2\u2033 in diameter and cut circles out of the dough. Do not twist the cutter as that inhibits rising, simply apply a lot of pressure to the cutter and then lift the cutter with a scone inside. Place over the baking tray and gently pop the scone out onto the tray. I found that dipping the cutter in flour and then shaking the excess off helps a lot when it comes to releasing the scones onto the tray.",
				"8. Bring any dough leftovers very gently into a ball and cut out some more \u2013 they won\u2019t be as good as the first batch, but if you handle the dough super gently, they will still be very tasty.",
				"9. Place the scones on the prepared baking tray, making sure there is some space around each one. Mix all the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl and glaze the tops of the scones with a pastry brush.",
				"10. Sprinkle each scone with some demerara sugar (if using) and bake for 12-15 minutes. My oven heats the right hand side more than the left so after 12 minutes the ones on the right were done, but the other ones needed another 3 minutes. I rotated the tray before baking them for the last 3 minutes so that they are evenly browned on all sides.",
				"11. Let the scones cool down a little before cutting them in half with a serrated knife and filling them with coconut yoghurt and jam."

				"10. Heat up a small non-stick pan (mine was 20 cm / 8\u2033 in diameter) on a medium heat. Allow it to get hot before brushing its surface with \u00bd tsp of oil. Allow the oil to heat up.

If any gaps form, quickly fill them with a little more batter, but be careful not to make the pancakes too thick by ladling too much extra batter on top of the set batter. There should be lots of little holes forming on the surface as soon as the batter hits the hot pan. If they don\u2019t form it means that your pan / oil isn\u2019t hot enough!",
				"12. Allow the pancake to cook on one side without touching it until the edges become golden and start lifting up gently (approx. 2-3 minutes). Turn the pancake gently using a large spatula and cook on the other side for 1-2 more minutes. The longer you cook them the crispier they\u2019ll become, but they will lose their flexibility. I don\u2019t mind that, but please adjust the cooking time to YOUR preference. Also be aware of your pan\u2019s hot spots \u2013 once you flip your pancake, make sure you adjust its position on the other side to ensure that there are no raw batter areas.",
				"13. Fill each crepe with sweet potato filling and sprinkle with a generous amount of coriander. Serve with coconut yoghurt and a dollop of sour chutney on the side."

						"1. Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my low-range (and fairly old) blender, this is the only way I can achieve a smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.",

						"3. Once smooth, add another quarter of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there is enough moisture in this recipe to obtain thick and smooth cream-cheese like mixture.",

						"1. Place flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and very gradually (to prevent lumpy batter) start adding in plant milk, whisking the whole time. Whisk well after each addition to ensure that there are no lumps in the batter. Initially the batter will look thick and gloopy, but it will start looking like a cr\u00eape batter with every milk addition.",
						"2. Whisk in the smooth almond butter (I like to thin it out with a little almond milk separately first) and maple syrup and adjust the amount of plant milk to ensure the batter is the right consistency \u2013 it should be runny, but should coat the back of the spoon. I found that buckwheat flour requires more milk (approx. 600 ml / 2\u00bd cups) than plain flour or GF plain flour mix (approx. 480 ml / 2 cups), so please proceed with caution \u2013 it\u2019s easier to thin the batter than to thicken it.",
						"3. Heat up a medium (I used 24 cm / 9.5 \u201d pan) non-stick pan on a medium heat. Brush the pan with a small amount of oil to make sure that the pancakes do not stick. Take the pan into your hand (off the stove) and pour a thin layer of batter (I found that 80 ml / 1/3 cup of batter is optimal) into the pan and swivel it well to form a thin, round cr\u00eape. Put the pan back on the stove and cook until the cr\u00eape no longer sticks to the pan and can be flipped to the other side. Once flipped, cook the cr\u00eape on the other side for another minute or so.",
						"4. Put cooked crepes in a stack so that they do not dry out and become brittle.",

Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start bringing the dough together with your hands. If after a little bit of kneading the dough isn\u2019t holding together (initially it\u2019s supposed to be a bit dry to the touch but hold together), it may need a bit more hot water. It is very important to add the water in very small amounts\u00a0as too much water will negatively affect the dough. Knead it for about 5-10 minutes with your hands (after kneading, the dough should become very smooth and elastic, but not sticky) and then set aside for 30 minutes under\u00a0a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, grab \u00bc of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be\u00a0about\u00a01-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough, the tastier the dumplings. With a cookie cutter or an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place less than a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each circle, fold the circle in half and press the edges of the semi-circle together with your fingers. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely. Put the finished\u00a0dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a damp kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you\u2019ve used up all of the dough or the filling.",
						"3. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water is boiling, throw\u00a0in 10 dumplings at a time and from the moment the water comes to the boil again cook for 5 minutes (depending on how thick your dough is). Once the time is up, fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Put a new batch in\u00a0until you have cooked\u00a0them all.",
						"4. OPTIONAL STEP: Heat up a little olive oil in a pan and place the cooled-down (they should be cold!) dumplings in the pan. Turn them after they\u2019ve browned on one side. Make sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan and do not turn the dumplings too early as they may start falling apart.",
						"5. Whilst you are frying your dumplings, warm up the rest of your sauteed shallots, season them with salt and pepper and serve with your dumplings."

						"8. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevent the Wellington from bursting while in the oven.",
						"9. Brush the pastry with plant milk and sprinkle with coarse salt, sesame seeds or poppy seeds.",
						"10. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden. Serve with your favourite sides and the beet gravy on the side."

Here is a handy guide to making shortcurst pastry that I follow.\nOnce the mixture is uniform and there are no large lumps left (to check, shake the bowl lightly, they will come to the surface), rub the small bits of oil into the flour with your fingers until there are no lumps left. Yes, I know, it does take some time!\nFinally trickle in cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife.\nAdd the water very gradually as too much will make the pastry tough. To check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a tiny bit more water, mix it in and check again.\nOnce the dough is the right consistency, form it into a flattened ball quickly \u2013 handle the dough as little as possible, wrap it in cling film and chill for 60 minutes.\nRemove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife or by rolling a rolling pin along the baking case edge. Patch any holes up with the cut off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.\nPierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.\n45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.

						"2. Put all the liquid ingredients: coconut cream, maple syrup, lemon juice and vanilla extract at the bottom of the blender.",
						"3. Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my average blender, this is the only way I can achieve a smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.",
						"4. Add about a quarter of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth then add another quarter and process until smooth. Continue until you\u2019ve added all the cashews.",
						"5. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe to turn the cashews into a smooth and creamy frosting.",

In terms of the veggies, you could simply cook them in the simmering curry, but that gives you less control over the \u2018doneness\u2019 of the individual elements and it affects the colour of the greens.

						"1. Cut twelve 8 cm / 3\u2033 by 8 cm / 3\u2033 squares from a piece of baking paper. Set aside.",
						"2. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt. Add about 120 ml / \u00bd cup of warm (that\u2019s important) water and 1 tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, tablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough that is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until it is elastic and smooth. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel. Allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes.",
						"3. After the dough has rested, knock the air out with your hands and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. I weighed the dough and then divided it evenly using scales, but you don\u2019t need to be as accurate.",
						"4. Knead each ball briefly before rolling it out into a 10 cm / 4\u2033 diameter circle. If you know how, roll the edges thinner and leave the centre thicker, but that\u2019s not necessary.",
						"5. Place each dough circle in the palm of your hand, put about 1 tbsp of filling in the middle of the circle and then pinch the edges above the filling so that the dumpling resembles a little sack of money. You can crimp the top nicely if you have the skills, but I don\u2019t yet so I simply folded the opposite edges of the circle together making sure the top is nicely sealed. You don\u2019t want the dumplings to burst open during steaming.",
						"6. While filling the dumplings, warm up water in a pot that your steamer will fit onto. You don\u2019t need the water to boil, you simply want the water to be warm enough to generate some steam so that the dumplings can prove in the steaming basket before getting steamed.",
						"7. As soon as you finish one dumpling, place it on a square of baking paper and put it in the steamer \u2013 but don\u2019t put the steamer over the water just yet. Leave ample space between dumplings as they will get much bigger after you are done.",
						"8. Once all 12 dumplings are ready in the steamer, place the steamer over warm (the heat should be off) water and allow the dumplings to prove for 20-30 minutes until they get about 1/3 bigger.",
						"9. After the proofing time, bring the water under the steamer to a gentle simmer and steam the dumplings for about 15-20 minutes.",
						"10. Take the steamer off the water, but do not peak inside yet. Allow the buns to rest for 5-10 minutes before taking them out of the steamer."

Mix all of the sauce ingredients: tamari / soy sauce, wine, hoisin sauce, sugar, five spice, pepper and vinegar (if using, it\u2019s not traditionally used, but I felt like it\u2019s needed to cut through the sweetness) in a bowl. Prepare the cornflour / cornstarch slurry by mixing cornflour with 2 tbsp of water in another small bowl.",
						"3. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil in a wok. Add mushroom or tofu dice to the hot oil and stir-fry until the extra moisture cooks out (mushrooms only) and the dice is lightly browned. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.",
						"4. Clean or wipe the wok clean and heat up another tablespoon of oil, keeping the heat fairly low.",
						"5. Stir-fry the diced shallots until translucent, followed by the diced ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for about a minute, until the garlic gets fragrant.",
						"6. Return the mushrooms (or tofu) to the wok and season with 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil.",
						"7. Lower the heat, pour the prepped sauce over the filling and mix everything well. Taste and adjust the seasoning (add a pinch of salt, for example) if necessary.",
						"8. Finally, add the cornflour / cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce (give it a good stir before adding to the work). Allow it to bubble gently for a few seconds, switch the heat off and set aside to cool."

					"PASTRY": [
						"1. Combine the flour, icing sugar, (plus cornstarch and xanthan gum if making GF pastry) in a large bowl. If using maple syrup instead of icing sugar, don\u2019t add it just yet. Add the softened coconut oil and rub it into the dry ingredients with your fingers until your flour looks like breadcrumbs and there are no lumps of coconut oil left.",
						"2. If you are using maple syrup, add it now and the chances are that you will not need to add any water to bring the dough together. If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup. Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it up in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
						"3. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",
						"4. Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.",
						"5. 45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line the pastry case with a large piece of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.",
						"6. Blind bake the pastry for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beads and bake for another 10 minutes."
					]
				},
				{
					"FILLING": [
						"1. While the pastry cases are baking, prepare the filling. Cream oil and sugar (or maple syrup) with an electric whisk. Next, whisk in the flour. Add aquafaba, small amount at a\u00a0time. Whisk well after each portion of aquafaba.",
						"2. Finally, gently fold in the almond meal and almond essence with a spatula. You should end up with a thick batter (it will be a bit less thick if you used maple syrup instead of sugar).",
						"3. Fill the pastry case with almond frangipane and use a silicon spatula to spread the filling evenly.",
						"4. Push as many raspberries as you can into the filling. It will rise during baking a fair bit so don\u2019t worry if raspberries are sticking out. If using frozen raspberries, dip each raspberry into cornflour / cornstach first before pushing it into the filling as frozen fruit tends to ooze more water during baking.",
						"5. Bake the tart for about 45 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

						"1. Place the almonds in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside for 30 minutes to soak. Rinse afterwards.",
						"2. Place the lemon juice, garlic, almond milk OR oil, a good pinch of salt, 1-2 tbsp of water (or more almond milk) and rinsed almonds in an upright blender.",
						"3. Blend until smooth, use a spatula to return the mixture that stays on the walls of your blender back to the centre. The mixture will eventually get really thick and the blender will struggle. I have a little trick to combat this, but please be very careful as it requires you to have the lid off while the blender is running. I slide my spatula flat against the wall of the blender and ever so slightly push the mixture into the centre, which sort of feeds it back into the blades again and prevents an air bubble from forming underneath the surface. I keep on doing that while the mixture is blending, being extra careful that I go nowhere near the blades. This technique allows me to get the mixture super smooth and creamy, but use it at your own discretion.",
						"4. Taste and adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to taste. Add miso and nutritional yeast at this point if using. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture tastes quite strong at this point, it will mellow out during the next two stages of preparation.",
						"5. If you want your \u2018feta\u2019 to be shaped like a block, find a rectangular mould with drainage holes (I used this tofu press for this) and line it with a piece of dense cheesecloth (if the cheesecloth isn\u2019t dense enough to hold the mixture inside, double or triple layer it). Otherwise line a sieve with a piece of cheesecloth and place it over a bowl.",
						"6. Place the cheese mixture inside the cheesecloth. Even out with a spatula if you are making a block, if not bring the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a ball. Fold one side of the cheesecloth over evened out feta, then place the tofu press lid on top and weigh the mixture down (block) or squeeze very gently (bundle) to allow the excess water to drip away. Place in the fridge overnight to allow the mixture to thicken and for the excess moisture to drain away. At this point the cheese will be creamy but still fairly soft / wet \u2013 perfect for spreading on a bagel, but for this application we will need to dry it out in the oven.",
						"7. Gently place the drained cheese block / ball on a paper lined baking tray. Bake in a 140\u00ba C (285 \u00ba F) oven for about 45 minutes, until you feel quite a bit of resistance when you try to press the cheese gently with your finger. Allow it to cool down completely before cutting or it will fall apart. After baking, this cheese has a yellow crust (more pronounced if you use olive oil), which I simply trim off with a serrated knife before placing it on the salad.",
						"8. This cheese freezes well, so if you\u2019ve made too much (I tend to make a double batch), freeze some for putting on a pizza or in a salad later."

I only had 7 sheets in my filo packet, but thanks to generous offcuts I created an extra 3 layers to go in the middle. Again, make sure to brush each layer with a little oil as you go along.",
						"12. Sprinkle the remainder of the filling and cover with another 3-4 layers of lightly greased filo. Like I said earlier, the more layers the better.",

						"14. Bake in a pre-heated oven for about 45 minutes, until the top is nicely browned.",
						"15. As soon as the baklava is ready, brush it while still piping hot with the cold (that\u2019s important as otherwise it\u2019ll end up soggy) syrup. Sprinkle with finely chopped pistachios. If you made more than you are able to eat, just freeze the remainder."

						"3. Cut the nori into strips where the size matches the sides of the tofu. I held each tofu in between two strips of nori when coating, but you could also wrap the entire block in nori if you want a more intense fishy taste.",
						"4. If going down the cornflour route, prepare a shallow bowl and a large plate. In the bowl, whisk cornflour with approximately 120 ml / \u00bd cup of water to achieve a sticky mixture. Pour the breadcrumbs and \u00bc tsp of salt on the plate and mix well. Hold each piece of tofu between two strips of nori and spoon the cornflour mixture over the tofu. I found that dipping does not work so well in this case as the nori tends to separate and get stuck in the cornflour mixture. Press into the breadcrumbs and repeat if you want an extra thick coating.",

Place flour on the first plate, aquafaba in the bowl and the breadcrumbs mixed with \u00bc tsp of salt on the second plate. Place two nori strips on each side of the tofu finger \u2013 the nori strips should stick to its moist sides. Then coat the tofu in flour, then aquafaba and finally breadcrumbs.

Once the oil heats up (it\u2019s important that it is hot enough \u2013 a breadcrumb thrown into it should sizzle immediately, but not burn), fry each piece of tofu for about 1-2 minutes on each side \u2013 until the coating becomes golden. Place the freshly fried pieces on a plate lined with a kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil."

						"1. Place almonds in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside for 30 minutes to soak. Rinse afterwards.",
						"2. Place the lemon juice, sliced garlic, olive oil, a good pinch of salt, 1-2 tbsp of water (or unsweetened almond milk if you have any to hand) and rinsed almonds in an upright blender.",
						"3. Blend until smooth, use a spatula to return the mixture that stays on the walls of your blender back to the centre. The mixture will eventually get really thick and the blender will struggle. I have a little trick to combat this, but please be very careful as it requires you to have the lid off while the blender is running. I slide my spatula flat against the wall of the blender and ever so slightly push the mixture into the centre, which sort of feeds it back into the blades again and prevents an air bubble from forming underneath the surface. I keep on doing that while the mixture is blending, being extra careful that I go nowhere near the blades. This technique allows me to get the mixture super smooth and creamy, but use it at your own discretion.",
						"4. Taste and adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to taste. Add miso and nutritional yeast at this point if using. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture tastes quite strong at this point, it will mellow out during the next two stages of preparation.",
						"5. Line a sieve with a piece of cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Place the cheese mixture inside the cheesecloth. Bring the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a ball. Squeeze very gently to allow the excess water to drip away. Place the sieve in the fridge overnight to allow the mixture to thicken and for the excess moisture to drain away. At this point the cheese will be creamy but still fairly soft / wet \u2013 perfect for spreading on a bagel, but if you prefer slightly firmer cheese, I recommend drying it out in the oven (see next step).",
						"6. Place the drained cheese ball in a greased ramekin and bake in a 160\u00ba C (320 \u00ba F) oven for about 30 minutes. Allow it to cool down completely before cutting."

						"3. Peel your onion and cut into wedges. Coat in 1-2 tsp of olive oil and bake in the pre-heated oven for about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
						"4. While the onion is roasting, toast walnuts in a dry pan until fragrant and lightly browned in places. Move them about the pan the entire time as they burn easily.",

						"2. Divide the chopped cashews into six portions roughly. Chuck the first portion of chopped cashews into a blender with vanilla seeds, coconut cream, maple syrup and lemon juice. Process until super smooth.",
						"3. Once smooth, add another portion of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe (from coconut cream, lemon juice and maple syrup if using) not to have to use any water, which means you\u2019ll end up with a thick and smooth cream-cheese like mixture.",
						"4. Place the mixture in the refrigerator for a few hours to firm up."

						"3. Once thickened, spread the jam at the bottom of the set tart base. You\u2019ll need about 1\u00bd cups of jam, there will be a bit left over (use it to top your porridge with, for example)."

						"1. Place smooth peanut butter, maple syrup and coconut cream in a medium bowl. Whisk with a wire whisk until you obtain a uniform mixture, but don\u2019t overwisk as the mixture may start releasing oil. Don\u2019t panic if the mixture appears to seize halfway through, it happened to me on two occasions but more vigorous mixing recovered it. If mixing doesn\u2019t help, add a tiny splash of hot water and whisk some more.",
						"2. Place aquafaba in a clean (that\u2019s very important as any grease residue will prevent the aquafaba from foaming) glass or metal bowl. Add vinegar (or lemon juice). Whip it with an electric hand mixer until you achieve stiff peaks \u2013 you should be able to invert the bowl and the whipped aquafaba should not budge an inch. If it does it means that it hasn\u2019t been whipped enough.",
						"3. Fold stiff aquafaba into the peanut mixture with a clean spatula until the two are well incorporated. Do it VERY GENTLY as you don\u2019t want to knock too much air out but thoroughly (peanut mixture is heavy so tends to drop to the bottom initially). The mixture will deflate a fair bit, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal. Fill the tart with the peanut mousse mixture and place in the fridge for about 6-8 hours (or overnight) to allow the mousse to set.",
						"4. Once the mousse has had a chance to set, decorate the tart some dark chocolate and some fresh raspberries. Even though I drizzled my cake with melted chocolate for the photos, I recommend decorating it with chocolate shavings instead. Once drizzled chocolate sets, it becomes hard and it cuts into delicate mousse layer once you attempt to slice the tart, producing messy looking results."

						"1. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F fan) and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"2. Cut off the bulbous part of your butternut squash (save it for another use), peel the solid part and cut it in half lengthwise. Brush the two halves with a bit of olive oil on both sides and bake in the pre-heated oven for about 25-35 minutes (depending on size), until almost cooked all the way through. Let the two halves cool down completely.",
						"3. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a heavy bottomed pan. Add finely diced onion and fry on a low-medium heat until gently caramelised. Add chopped garlic, stir-fry until softened and fragrant.",
						"4. Add chopped herbs and stir-fry for about another minute.",
						"5. Add in chopped spinach, cranberries, olives and 50 g / \u00bd cup of pecans and, if the pan is too dry, perhaps a splash of water (or veggie stock or vegan wine). Allow the spinach to wilt into the pan. Season with salt, pepper and chilli.",
						"6. Once the spinach has wilted, allow all the water to cook out completely. Cool the mixture off. Once cool, stir 45 g / \u00bd cup breadcrumbs through the mixture so that they soak up any excess moisture."

						"1. Place balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring it to the boil gently and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes or so until the liquid reduces by about \u00bd and becomes thick. Beware that it will become even thicker once it cools so don\u2019t let it reduce too much. If you do, add a splash of water to bring it back."
					]
				},
				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Place the sheet of pastry in front of you so that the longer edge runs parallel to the work bench (I used a Jus Roll puff pastry sheet, which measures 23 cm / 9\u2033 by 35 cm / 13.5\u2033 cm). You will place your filling in the horizontal middle of the pastry. The width of the area designated for the filling is determined by the width of your butternut squash (mine was 8 cm / 3\u2033 wide).",
						"2. Sprinkle the remainder of the breadcrumbs over the area where the filling will be placed making sure you leave about 2 cm / 1 \u201d margin at the top an bottom. The breadcrumbs will prevent the bottom of the Wellington from getting soggy.",
						"3. Next pile the spinach filling over the breadcrumbs, into a well compressed, rectangular parcel (you may end up with some leftover mixture).",
						"4. Place the two halves of the butternut squash on top of the spinach parcel so that the cut ends touch each other in the centre. Brush the cut ends with a bit of balsamic glaze to \u2018glue\u2019 the two pieces together.",
						"5. Glaze the top and sides of the butternut squash halves with balsamic glaze and then sprinkle them with the rest of the chopped pecans \u2013 the nuts will create a barrier stopping the pastry from getting soggy.",
						"6. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm / 1\u2033 incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack to be able to create a braid at the top. You can make the incisions perpendicular to the log (like I did in mine) or at a slight diagonal angle, it\u2019s up to you.",
						"7. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. This method works great here as it prevents slack in the pastry and allows for tight wrapping despite the slightly irregular shape of the filling. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevent the Wellington from bursting while in the oven.",
						"8. Brush the pastry with soy milk.",
						"9. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden.",
						"10. Serve with your favourite side dishes (like hasselback potatoes, for example) drizzled with the balsamic reduction you made earlier."

Place the slices on a baking tray cut side down and return them to the oven for the second bake. Bake for about 15-20 minutes, until your biscotti achieves the desired crispness and colour \u2013 remember the longer you bake them the harder they get. I also found that version 1 needed about 5 minutes longer than version 2."

				"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add 120 ml / \u00bd cup of hot water and 1 tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, teaspoon by teaspoon. Knead it for a few minutes with your hands and then set aside for 30 minutes under a clean kitchen towel or pierced (so that it can breathe) cling film so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
				"2. Heat up olive oil in a pan. Fry spring onions, garlic and ginger. Keep on stirring to make sure they don\u2019t burn.",
				"3. Chop soaked shiitake and oyster mushrooms into a fine dice. Add to the onion, garlic and ginger mixture together with chopped spinach, five spice, white pepper and chilli. Let the excess moisture from the mushrooms and spinach cook out.",
				"4. Season with soy sauce, rice vinegar and mirin. Continue frying the filling until excess water evaporates but not so long that the mixture is too dry (it should clump together easily). If the mixture is too wet, add a handful of breadcrumbs to soak up the excess moisture.",
				"5. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, divide it into 4 even portions. Roll the first portion into a thick snake shape and then divide it into 8 even pieces.",
				"6. Roll the first piece into a ball in your hands, then place on the table and flatten it into a thick disc with the palm of your hand. Hold the disc with your right hand and a rolling pin in your left hand \u2013 make sure that the rolling pin makes contact with the bottom of the dough disc. Keep on rotating the disc a few degrees with your right hand, while you roll the rolling pin back and forth over the disc in order to create a large, flat circle of dough (see this video  for the exact technique).\nPlace a heaped teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of the flattened circle and seal the dough over the filling at the top \u2013 here is another helpful video \u2013 I used technique number 5. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely.\nPut the finished dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.\nHeat up a little peanut oil in a lidded frying pan. Once the oil is hot, place as many potstickers as you can (you may need to do this in batches) on the pan without them touching each other. Fry for 2 minutes, then add a splash of water to the pan (1 cm) and put the lid on. Let the dumplings cook in their own steam for about 6-8 minutes \u2013 depending on how thin your dough is. Once all the water has cooked out, take the lid off and leave the potstickers on heat for another minute or two so that the bottom is nice and crispy.\nMix all dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl. Serve potstickers immediately with the dipping sauce on the side.",

						"2. If you are using maple syrup, add it now and the chances are that you will not need to add any water to bring the dough together. If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup. Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it up in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
						"3. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",

						"2. Finally, gently fold in the almond meal, zest and almond essence with a spatula. You should end up with a thick batter (it will be a bit less thick if you used maple syrup instead of sugar).",
						"3. Fill the pastry case with almond frangipane and use a silicon spatula to spread the filling evenly. Place the fig quarters on top \u2013 don\u2019t worry about them sticking above the level of the filling \u2013 the filling will rise during baking a fair bit.",
						"4. Bake the tart for about 50-60 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

				"4. Finally add water \u2013 be careful, do it very gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is and whether you\u2019ve used almond pulp or dry almond flour. I added just over 1 tbsp. Combine all the ingredients into a dough. It shouldn\u2019t be either too dry or too sticky. If too dry add a touch more water, if too sticky dust with some extra buckwheat flour.",
				"5. Preheat your oven to 175\u00b0 C fan forced / 350\u00b0 F fan forced (or 195\u00b0 C / 380\u00b0 F on the regular setting).",
				"6. Place your dough on a large sheet of baking paper. Spread it with your fingers until fairly flat, then cover with another piece of baking paper and roll into a very thin (2 mm / 0.08\u2033 ) sheet with a rolling pin. Pay attention to the middle as it tends to be thicker than the sides.",
				"7. Take the top layer of the baking paper off and cut the dough into similar size pieces with a knife or a pizza cutter.",
				"8. Bake for about 15-22 minutes. The edge pieces are going to be ready sooner (about 15-17 min) while the middle ones will take a little bit longer. I tend to remove the edge ones earlier (they will be very hot, so be careful) and spread the middle ones out a little so that they bake faster. They are done when golden \u2013 don\u2019t let them brown too much though as they will become hard. Cool and keep in an airtight container."

Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe (from the coconut cream, lemon juice and maple syrup if using) not to have to use any water, which means you\u2019ll end up with a smooth and creamy cheesecake mixture.

				"1. If using whole almonds, chop them on the diagonal. Heat up a small pan on a medium-high heat. Toast chopped almonds (or almond flakes) until browned and fragrant. Make sure you stir them frequently as they burn easily.",
				"2. Place maple syrup and balsamic vinegar in a small pot. Place on a low heat and simmer for about 20 minutes until the excess moisture cooks out and you are left with a thick, syrupy dressing. Beware that the mixture will thicken a lot once it cools down. If you\u2019ve over-reduced your glaze and it is no longer pourable, add a small amount of water to bring it back. If your mixture is too thin after cooling, reduce it further.",
				"3. If you want to go the extra mile, you can roast your peaches for this salad, although that\u2019s by no means necessary, fresh peaches work beautifully too. To roast the peaches, slice each peach into 8 to 12 wedges. Heat up a griddle pan on a medium-high heat and brush it with a bit of olive oil. Once the pan is hot, place peaches on it raw side on, roast for about 2 minutes on each side until lightly charred.",
				"4. Trim the top of the fennel off, core it and slice it into very thin slices using a mandolin or a sharp knife. Place it in a small bowl, sprinkle with lemon juice and mix \u2013 this step prevents discolouration.",
				"5. Toss baby spinach, rocket, red onion and fennel in a small amount (1-2 tsp) of olive oil if you wish. Season with salt and a small amount of black pepper.",
				"6. Place salad base at the bottom of a large platter. Arrange grilled peaches on top and sprinkle with roasted almonds. Drizzle balsamic glaze on top and decorate with fresh basil and an extra grind of black pepper."

						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and turmeric. Add aquafaba and mix it into the flour. The dough will need a bit of water to come together (we used 2 tbsp / 30 ml), but be careful not to add too much as this will give you a dough that is too wet. Knead the dough for at least 5 mins and then set aside for 60 minutes under a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, take a portion of the dough (1/3 for example) and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out as thin as you can (2-3 mm), the thinner the dough the tastier the ravioli. You can obviously use a pasta machine to roll out your dough if you have one.",
						"3. Use a 5 cm / 2\u2033 cookie cutter or an upside down glass to cut out circles of the dough. Place about a teaspoon of filling on half of the cut out circles. Place another circle on top and drape it around the filling, taking care not to trap any air pockets inside. Seal the two circles of dough with your fingers. If you want them to look like mine, go around each raviolo and crimp the sealed edges with the end of a fork. Put the finished dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you have used up all the dough and / or all the filling.",
						"4. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water boils, place 5-6 ravioli (it\u2019s important not to overcrowd the pot) in the boiling water and cook, on a rolling boil, for about 5 minutes. After the time is up, fish cooked ravioli out with a slotted spoon, shaking excess water off gently, and place them on a plate. Cook all the remaining ravioli in this way.",
						"5. To serve, saut\u00e9 2 cloves of garlic in a bit of olive oil. Baste the ravioli in the garlic oil gently. Serve with a sprinkling of salt, lemon zest and some more chilli if you wish."

Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 45 minutes.",

Place the rolled-out dough over a mini tart case and gently line the inside of the hole with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it snugly fits into all the nooks and crannies.

If you don\u2019t have a coffee grinder, you can use a food processor instead , but that will result in a coarser grind and therefore a less delicate frangipane.",
						"2. While the pastry cases are baking, prepare the filling. Cream oil and sugar with an electric whisk. Next, whisk in the flour. Finally add aquafaba, one tablespoon at a\u00a0time. Whisk well after each portion of aquafaba.",
						"3. Gently fold in ground pistachios with a spatula. If prefer less sweet desserts, try adding a bit of matcha powder to the batter, it will contrast the sweetness nicely. You should end up with a very sticky and thick batter.",
						"4. Divide the batter between pastry cases \u2013 use a silicon spatula or clean fingers to tap the filling into the cases snugly. Place half a strawberry on top of each filling \u2013 don\u2019t worry about it sticking above the level of the filling \u2013 the filling will rise during baking a bit and be snug around the strawberry. If you have large strawberries though, you can chop the bottom of the halves off to make them a little less tall.",
						"5. Bake the tarts for about 20-22 minutes, until the filling is just a touch browned around the rim. Remove from the oven and allow the tarts to cool down before removing them from the tins. The tops will crisp up nicely as the tarts cool down."

Let the chickpea cooking water cool down completely (it\u2019s best to refrigerate it for a few hours prior to using if you don\u2019t need to make hummus straight away).",
				"3. OPTIONAL STEP: Now, it\u2019s time to peel the chickpeas \u2013 you can skip this step at your own peril. It is worth it though as it only took me 20 minutes to peel them and you get a much smoother hummus if you get rid of the skin. To peel them, simply rub them between your hands and then slip the skin off gently with your fingers. Once peeled, let the chickpeas cool down completely.",
				"4. Use an upright blender. In my experience, it will give your hummus a smoother texture than a food processor. Divide your chickpeas into two batches. Put \u00bd cup of fridge-cold liquid (water or aquafaba) into the blender, half of your chickpeas, roasted red peppers, tahini and lemon juice. Put the lid on and start trickling cold liquid in slowly while the mixture is blending. Once your first batch is smooth and a little on the runny side, add in the remaining chickpeas and blend them in, trickling in more liquid as needed. In order to help the motor work the thick mixture, make small circles with the tip of your spatula (in the direction of the turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture (do not dip the spatula deeper than literally a few millimetres or else you will damage the blades). This will help to burst an air pocket under the surface and helps the motor to turn.",

				"6. Serve with a drizzle of chilli oil (if using), toasted bread or pita bread, olives, pickles and anything that takes your fancy. Store in an airtight container in the fridge, it keeps for about 3-4 days."

				"1. Chop your chocolate roughly \u2013 I tend to whack an unopened packet against my workbench to break it up. Place the broken-up chocolate in a glass bowl over a water bath and melt very slowly (I use setting 1 out of 6). Once the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat, but keep the bowl over the hot water.",
				"2. As the chocolate is melting, place the coconut milk in a small pot and warm it up a little bit. Dissolve the instant coffee in the warmed-up milk. I went for 2 tsp of instant coffee to get a hint of coffee in the truffles. If you don\u2019t want to taste coffee, go for 1 tsp instead \u2013 this will simply bring out the chocolate flavour more.",
				"3. Slowly add warm coconut milk to the melted chocolate. If it seizes (chocolate becomes grainy and hard), don\u2019t worry, it happens sometimes but as we are essentially making a ganache here, that\u2019s no problem. Just keep on adding milk and whisking at the same time. At some point the chocolate will return to its glossy and runny state.",
				"4. Whisk in the maple syrup and finally the hazelnut butter. If you happen to have hazelnut (or vanilla extract), add a few drops (you could use both!), but I also made a batch without them and, while they deepen the flavour, they are totally optional.",
				"5. Let the mixture come to room temperature and place in the fridge overnight for it to harden.",
				"6. Before taking the mixture out of the fridge, put aside at least 20 (22 to be safe) hazelnuts and chop the rest quite finely. Spread the chopped hazelnuts on a tray or clean baking sheet.",
				"7. Scoop portions of the mixture. Use kitchen scales to measure out equal sized portions of the mixture first or just eyeball the portions if you don\u2019t have kitchen scales. Flatten each portion in the palm of your hand, place a hazelnut in the middle and then close the truffle mixture around the hazelnut. Quickly roll between the palms of your hands (that\u2019s one area where permanently cold hands help a lot) and then coat the truffle in the chopped hazelnuts. I recommend working in small batches as the mixture will get messier to work with the longer it sits around. Transfer \u00bc of the mixture to a chilled bowl and place the rest of the mixture in the freezer while you roll the first 5 truffles. Proceed in the same way with the remaining \u00be of the mixture.",

Taste before adding any salt as, in my experience, due to capers being quite salty, there is usually no extra salt necessary. Set aside until you are ready to dress your salad.",
				"2. Heat up a heavy-bottomed pan or a griddle pan on a medium-high heat. Brush it with a little bit of oil and throw the asparagus on. Grill it for 2-3 minutes (until tender but still crunchy) moving it about the pan from time to time. Season with salt and pepper. If your asparagus is super fresh and young and you would rather consume it raw, shave it into ribbons using a speed peeler and it add it directly to the salad.",
				"3. Toss all the salad ingredients together. Add cooked quinoa (or steamed new potatoes would work too) if you want to bulk the salad up a bit, but that\u2019s completely optional. Dress just before serving and decorate with extra mint and roasted hazelnuts."

						"3. Set the oven to 250\u00b0 C / 480\u00b0 F. Empty the dough out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.",
						"4. Roll out 2 small pizzas from half of the dough on two well-oiled baking trays. We used a small roller to roll the pizzas out, but you can also simply push the dough out with your hands \u2013 just make sure to oil them lightly.",
						"5. Spread a layer of pesto on each pizza leaving a small border around it. Arrange the tomato halves, courgette slices, Romano pepper slices and pine nuts on top \u2013 leave a few gaps for asparagus (if grilling it separately) and peas.",
						"6. Bake each pizza in the hot oven for about 8-10 mins. Proceed in the same way with the remaining dough. I tend to roll out the 3rd pizza as soon as the first one comes out of the oven and 4th one as the 2nd one is ready.",
						"7. Once out of the oven, decorate the pizzas with grilled asparagus spears, green peas, capers and a few dollops of ricotta (if using). Season with salt, pepper, chilli flakes and an additional drizzle of pesto."

						"3. Stir in the hot chilli powder, ground coriander and cloves into the onion and garlic mixture. Fry off gently for a minute or so.",
						"4. Add in the chopped tomato and chopped apple and stir around. Add soy sauce, apple vinegar, sugarcane molasses, maple syrup and liquid smoke. Cook on a low heat until the apple chunks get cooked through (about 20-30 min). Add a splash of water from time to time if the pan looks dry.",
						"5. Once the apple is soft, transfer to a blender and add a trickle of water while blending to achieve ketchup consistency. Taste and sweeten with a touch more maple syrup if needed, but remember that the fries are quite sweet so a bit of sourness is desired. You may also want to add another 2 tbsp of olive oil for the sauce to get a nice shine and a richer texture."

						"6. Pre-heat the oven to 225\u00b0 C / 435\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"7. Using a small sieve sprinkle a thin amount of cornflour-spices mixture over the greased matchsticks. Make sure all sides are covered.",
						"8. Place the potato matchsticks on the baking tray in a single layer and make sure fries do not touch each other as otherwise they will end up soggy. The more space they have around them the crispier they will turn out.",
						"9. Bake for about 30-35 minutes. 20 minutes in, gently turn the fries to the other side. If you have some small fries in between larger ones, they will be done sooner so you may want to take them out a bit earlier. Sprinkle with salt once done \u2013 adding salt to the spices and cornflour mixture stops the fries from crisping up. Serve with vegan BBQ sauce on the side."

Reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Repeat this for 10 minutes. See this recipe for photos on how to knead if you\u2019re unsure.",

				"5. Empty the dough out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.",

This gives you a nice round bagel with a larger hole but it can potentially come apart in the future poaching step.",
				"9. METHOD 2 \u2013 Form the dough into a circle (like a flattened bread roll) and poke a hole through the middle with your thumb. This usually gives you a slightly \u201cfatter\u201d bagel with a smaller hole, but is highly unlikely to break apart in the future poaching step.",

				"12. When the bagels are about 50% bigger or have proved for around 30 minutes, they are ready for the poaching step. Note that I usually 2nd prove bread for twice as long as this, but I do a half proving time with bagels as I find the poaching step expands them too much if I give them a full prove.",

Turn the boiling water down to a simmer, add \u00bd tsp of baking soda to it and place as many bagels as comfortably fit in the saucepan for 90 seconds on one side, then turn them over and do them for 90 seconds on the other side before removing them from the water. You can do 1 minute on each side for \u201cbreadier\u201d bagels, or 2 minutes on each side for chewier bagels. Place them on the paper towel to dry for a few seconds before placing them on the lightly oiled baking trays.",
				"14. Glaze the top of the bagels with oil (this gives them a golden colour) and put them in the oven to bake for 15\u00a0minutes or until golden brown."

						"1. Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my low range (and fairly old) blender this is the only way I can achieve smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.",
						"2. Divide the chopped cashews into roughly six portions. Chuck one sixth of the chopped cashews into a blender with all of the coconut cream, half of the lime juice and maple syrup. Process until super smooth.",
						"3. Once smooth, add another sixth of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe (from coconut cream, lime juice and maple syrup if using) not to have to use any water, which means you\u2019ll end up with a smooth and creamy cheesecake mixture.",
						"4. Adjust the amount of lime juice to taste and season the mixture with freshly grated ginger. I like a strong taste of ginger so I used a lot of it, but I recommended you adjust the amount to your taste. At this point the mixture should be quite tangy and gingery \u2013 a flavour which will mesh really well with the other two sweet components \u2013 date caramel and almond brittle."

Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, tablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough that is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until elastic and smooth. Form the dough into a ball and rub a small amount of oil on the dough\u2019s surface to prevent drying. Place in a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel and place it somewhere warm (but not too warm, sticking it too close to a fireplace is a bad idea, for example) for 1-2 hrs or until it doubles in size.",

You can use a paper puncher for this or fold each circle in half 3 times and cut small circles out along the folded edges with a pair of scissors. Prepare also eight 5 cm / 2\u2033 squares of baking paper and insert into the buns to prevent the two halves from sticking to each other (you could also use oil instead).",
						"3. After the dough has doubled in size, tip it out onto a lightly floured surface and press the air our with your fingertips. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form small balls. Place the balls on a lightly floured surface, cover with a kitchen towel and leave for another 30 min.",
						"4. Using a rolling pin, roll the balls out into \u00bd cm / \u00bc\u201d thick oval shapes. Fold each shape in half and insert a square of baking paper between the two halves. Alternatively you could also oil the buns before folding in half.",
						"5. Line your bamboo steamer with paper circles you\u2019ve made earlier and place folded up buns inside for another 30 min of proving. If your steamer is too small (like mine), place four buns inside (two on each tier) and rest the remaining four on a baking paper lined and lightly dusted tray until you are ready to steam.",
						"6. Half fill a pot (which the steamer can comfortably sit on, of course) with water and place the steamer with the buns on top. Whack the heat to medium-high (I used setting 4 out of 6) and let the water come to a simmer \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to peak inside or you will ruin the buns. Once you can hear the water simmering vigorously, put the timer on to 10 mins. After the time is up, take the pot and steamer off the heat and rest the buns for another 5 minutes. This will spare the buns temperature shock and will prevent them from shrinking. After 5 minutes, lift the lid off and remove the buns gently. Cook the remaining four like you did the first four."

						"1. Place the first 3 ingredients in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and very gradually start adding in plant milk (60 ml / \u00bc cup at a time) whisking the whole time. Whisk well after each addition to ensure that there are no lumps in the batter. Initially the batter will look thick and gloopy, but it will start looking like a cr\u00eape batter with every milk addition.",
						"2. In a separate bowl, whisk aquafaba with a hand whisk until frothy and light and add it into the cr\u00eape batter.",
						"3. Finally whisk in maple syrup (if using), melted oil and adjust the amount of plant milk to ensure the batter is the right consistency \u2013 it should be runny, but should coat the back of the spoon.",
						"4. Heat up a medium (I used 24 cm / 9.5 \u201d pan) non-stick pan on a medium heat. Brush the pan with a small amount of oil to make sure that the pancakes do not stick. Take the pan into your hand (off the stove) and pour a thin layer of batter (I found that 60 ml / \u00bc cup of batter is optimal) into the pan and swivel it well to form a thin, round cr\u00eape. Put the pan back on the stove and cook until the crepe no longer sticks to the pan and can be flipped to the other side.

					"CARAMEL SAUCE (SUGAR VERSION)": [
						"1. Spread an even layer of sugar at the bottom of a dry pan or pot. Heat up the sugar on a medium heat (I used setting 3 out of 6). Refrain from stirring it, although if your pan has hot spots, you may need to gently manoeuvre the unmelted sugar into a hot spot. Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.",
						"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel, the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in the warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.",
						"3. There is a chance that once you add the coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup / 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, place the pan back on the stove and reduce the caramel gently to thicken the sauce."
					]
				},
				{
					"CARAMEL SAUCE (HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE)": [
						"1. Slowly heat up maple syrup in a pan. When it starts to boil gently, take it off the heat. Stir in almond butter and salt with a hand whisk. Return the pan to the stove and simmer very gently, stirring the caramel for another minute to thicken the sauce a little bit \u2013 remember that it will thicken a bit more as it cools anyway. If it\u2019s too thick once cool, stir in a few drops of plant milk to bring the desired consistency back. Set aside."

Place all the veggies in a large mixing bowl apart from a few strands of celeriac, which you may want to save until the end so that they don\u2019t get all pink from the beetroot (that\u2019s a purely an aesthetic consideration so feel free to override me).

					"FILLINGS": [
						"1. Put a small frying pan on a medium heat and dry roast walnuts until lightly browned and fragrant. Make sure you move them around the pan frequently as they burn easily. Chop roughly once cool.",
						"2. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"3. Peel the beetroots. Pound 3 tsp of dry rosemary with 1\u00bd tsp of coarse sea salt in a pestle and mortar until you get fine rosemary salt. Brush the beetroots with olive oil and sprinkle with some (not all) of the rosemary salt. Place on a baking tray and put into the hot oven for about 1 hour (until the beetroots can be easily pierced with a knife).",
						"4. Place balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring it to the boil gently and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes or so until the liquid reduces by about \u00bd and becomes thick. Beware that it will become even thicker once it cools so don\u2019t let it reduce too much. If you do, add a splash of water to bring it back.",
						"5. Heat up 3 tbsp of olive oil in a heavy base pan. Add finely chopped shallots to a hot oil (you want them to sizzle once added to the pan). Fry on a low heat stirring from time to time, until lightly browned. Add garlic and fry it off for a few minutes until soft and fragrant. Chop your mushrooms into a fine dice (you can also use a food processor) while you\u2019re frying the shallots and garlic.",
						"6. Now, remove one third of the shallot and garlic mixture and set aside. Add chopped up mushrooms into the pan and coat in the shallot and garlic mixture. Cook mushrooms on a medium heat until all the water evaporates.",
						"7. Add wine to the pan and allow it to cook out. Season the mushroom mixture with some of the rosemary salt and black pepper. Let it cool. Once cool, add chia egg and mix well. The mixture should be sticky but not watery.",
						"8. Wilt spinach in a warmed-up pan with a lid.  Once wilted, allow it to cool completely. Once cool squeeze all the water out of the spinach using your hands or a muslin cloth. Go over the spinach twice or even three times to ensure that it is as dry as possible. Place spinach in a large bowl, season with rosemary salt, pepper and nutritional yeast. Add shallot and garlic mixture you\u2019ve set aside in step 6, \u00bc cup of breadcrumbs and fold in toasted walnuts."

				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Line a baking tray with a fresh sheet of baking paper and heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F.",
						"2. Flour the baking paper very lightly and place a defrosted sheet of puff pastry on it so that the shorter pastry edge is facing you.",
						"3. Designate a long, narrow (about 10 cm / 4 in by 25 cm / 10 in) area where the filing mixture will be stacked. Place it about 5 cm / 2 in from the edge of the pastry so that the pastry on the other side of the filling is long enough to be folded over the filling. Leave 5 cm / 2 in  margin at the ends too so that you are able to fold the ends nicely. Scatter a bit of extra breadcrumbs on the pastry, under the filling to prevent a soggy bottom. Start the stack by making a long rectangle with the spinach mixture. Press it down well with your hands so that it is tightly packed. Place four roasted beetroots in a long row over the spinach. For more stability, you may want to skewer all the beetroots together with a long wooden skewer, which you can pull out after cutting into the Wellington. Now mould the mushroom mixture over the beetroots making sure it fills all the nooks and crannies tightly. Finally, fold the pastry over the filling as tightly as you can \u2013 it\u2019s good to have another pair of hands here to make sure the pastry is tightly wrapped around the filling. Seal it together with the 5 cm / 2 in margin you left on the other side. If there is too much overlap, trim the excess. Wrap the pastry at both ends like you would wrap a present. Make shallow cuts on the top of the Wellington with a sharp knife. Brush soy milk and aquafaba \u2018egg wash\u2019 all over the Wellington and sprinkle the top with your garnish of choice \u2013 I used black salt. Make three small holes in the pastry (on the side where the seam is) to ensure steam can escape during baking and the pastry does not burst. Bake for about 60 minutes, until golden.",
						"4. Serve with your favourite side dishes drizzled with the balsamic reduction you made earlier."

				"1. Place coconut oil in a small pot and melt it on the lowest setting. Let it cool down a little bit.",

				"3. Place melted coconut oil, dark brown sugar and reduced aquafaba in a large bowl. Cream them together with an electric whisk until well combined and slightly thickened. Add maple syrup and whisk some more until you get a homogeneous mixture.",
				"4. Fold 1/3 of the flour mix into the wet ingredients and, once combined, add the remaining two thirds, one by one. Make sure there are no flour pockets and everything is well combined but do not knead. The dough will be quite loose and sticky, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s the way it should be. Divide the dough roughly into 2 portions and wrap each in a piece of cling film (glad wrap). Place them in the fridge for at least 1 hour. You can safely keep it in the fridge overnight too.",
				"5. Before you are about to take the dough out of the fridge, set the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F and line two baking trays with a piece of baking paper.",
				"6. After resting, take the first portion of the dough out of the fridge. Give it a few minutes to bring it to room temperature. Roll it out (gently pressing with a rolling pin) on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out quite thick (about 5 mm / 0.2 inch) and cut the cookies out of it with cookie cutters. If you want the cookies to be crunchy, roll them out a bit thinner and bake them for longer.",
				"7. Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking trays. You don\u2019t need to leave a lot of space between them as they don\u2019t expand much. Group similar size cookies together so that they cook in the same time. Bake small cookies for about 7-9 minutes and larger for 10-12 minutes. The longer you bake them for the crispier (and less soft and chewy) they will turn out so adjust baking time to your preference.",
				"8. To make the icing, mix icing sugar with a very small amount of water (added very gradually) until you obtain a thick sugar paste. I used beetroot juice (squeezed with my hand from 1 coarsely grated beetroot) instead of water to make pink icing and a touch of matcha powder (and water) to make green icing. If you want to do that divide the icing sugar between 3 bowls and treat each portion accordingly.",
				"9. Place your icing into a small plastic or pastry bag. Push it all into one corner and cut a tiny bit off that corner with a pair of scissors. Start with a small hole and make it bigger if necessary. Apply the icing by squeezing the icing through the hole."

When it comes to the final, fourth batch the mixture will be very creamy and heavy \u2013 to help the blender, you may need take the lid of when blending, dip the tip of your spatula in the mixture and make circles (in the direction of the turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture. This will help you achieve a super creamy and smooth finish without the need for a power blender, but be careful not to dip the spatula so low that it catches on the working blades. Taste the mixture and add another tablespoon of maple syrup if desired, plus a few drops of vanilla essence to taste.",

Once the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat, but keep the bowl over the hot water. Gently stir in \u00bd cup / 120 ml of the cashew cream you\u2019ve just made.

Once the beetroots are cool enough to handle, peel the skin off.",

				"3. Process until smooth. If the mixture is a bit too thick, trickle more aquafaba (or cold water) through the opening in the lid. Once the mixture becomes homogeneous and thick and your average blender starts to struggle (if you have a Vitamix or a similar hi-tech blender you probably will not need to worry about this) start making circles on the surface of your hummus mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula (don\u2019t dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades).

Initially mix it all together with a spoon as the mixture will be too hot, then start kneading the dough with your hands \u2013 you may need to add another splash of water if  the dough still too dry. Knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Rest the dough for about 30 mins covered with a damp kitchen towel. The resting step is very important so do not skip it. You can also make the dough a day in advance and keep it in the fridge overnight. Bring it to room temperature before rolling tacos.",
				"2. If you\u2019re using regular tomatoes, de-seed them before chopping. Chop tomatoes into a fine dice. Add in chilli flakes, lime juice and sliced spring onion. Season with salt, pepper and sugar (if using). Set aside for the flavours to mingle.",
				"3. To make re-fried black beans, mash black beans using a potato masher. I like mine with some whole beans left in, but the consistency is up to you. Heat up the olive oil in a pan. Fry the onion until translucent, add in garlic and fry for another minute. Add in spices and fry for another minute. Add in crushed and whole beans, salt, lime juice and 1 cup of water. Simmer gently until most of the moisture has cooked out and the mixture has thickened \u2013 you can have it looser (add more water) or thicker \u2013 again, consistency is up to you.",
				"4. Once the dough has rested, divide it into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a ball. Set a medium, heavy-bottomed or griddle pan on a medium heat (it\u2019s important not to get the pan too hot, I used setting 4 out of 6). Start rolling out tortillas on a lightly floured surface. Refrain from adding too much flour as it will produce dry tacos. Once you are happy with the shape (they should be round*) and thickness (make them as thin as possible), put your taco on a hot pan. Little bubbles will start to appear after about 30 seconds, if any large air pockets appear pierce them with the top of a knife. After about 1-2 minutes from when the taco hits the pan, flip the taco and cook for only about 30 seconds on the other side. Do not let them sit in the hot pan for too long as it will produce dry and cracking tacos. Keep cooked tacos in a stack, in a warm place (low oven is a good bet) covered with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.",
				"5. Finally, assemble your tacos by putting lettuce, re-fried beans, spicy salsa, avocado slices, pickled onions (if using) and coriander in the middle of each taco. Serve 2-3 per person."

After a few minutes of gentle bubbling, the mixture will separate, turn an amber colour and start to bubble more vigorously. Watch the mixture carefully and the minute the sugar turns dark amber (don\u2019t push it too far as it will burn), take the pan off the heat.",
				"5. Add the cut apple pieces into the pan gradually, coat them in the caramel mixture and start to simmer on a low heat. As the apple starts to shrink you should then be able to fit all of the apple pieces in the pan. Caramelise the apples for another 15 minutes until they turn golden. Move the pieces around the pan so that they caramelise at the same pace. The sides touching the pan will cook quicker so if some pieces look more done than others, remove them from the pan and set aside on a small plate so that the other pieces have a chance to catch up.",
				"6. Add brandy and simmer for another 10 minutes (until the apple pieces are the same colour as the 2nd and 3rd photo). By the end, the apples should be pre-cooked enough that you should be able to insert a skewer into the flesh with a considerable amount of resistance.",

Once the first portion of the cashews is fairly smooth, slowly start adding the remaining cashews, blending well after each addition. If you want the cheese to have a ricotta-like texture, be careful not to over process it. If you want your cheese to be completely smooth, process until the mixture is silky smooth (like my 2nd photo \u2013 this cheese was super smooth like a cream cheese).",
				"3. Season with miso (see notes), nutritional yeast, salt and pepper, dry herbs, garlic and more lemon if you like your cheese on the tangy side.",

				"5. Pour activated agar mixture into the blender and blend well. Pour the cheese into a small dish to cool down and set. It tastes better the next day once the flavours have had a chance to mingle but it will be ready to eat after 15-20 min. Store in the fridge for 3-4 days.",

Once the first portion of the cashews is fairly smooth, slowly start adding the remaining cashews, blending well after each addition.",
				"7. Since you are not using agar, you simply need to add minimum amount of liquid (that includes coconut cream or/and water) to the cashews in order to retain thick consistency without the need for a thickener. At some point your blender will struggle to process the mixture as it will be very thick and heavy. To remedy this, take blender\u2019s lid off and make small circles (in the direction of the turning blades), with a spatula, a few millimetres below the surface of the cheese mixture to help the blades turn. Please be very careful not to dip the spatula too deep or too close to the blades as it will damage them.",
				"8. Season with miso (see notes), nutritional yeast, salt and pepper, dry herbs, garlic and more lemon if you like your cheese on the tangy side. Transfer it to a jar and place in the fridge. It will become thicker and spreadable by the next day."

If you see no water seeping out from under the grain, it means you are good to go. Switch off the heat completely and let quinoa sit on a hot hob (with lid firmly on) for another 5 mins to finish off cooking in its own steam. Once ready, cool it down completely before adding it to the salad as otherwise the salad leaves will wilt.",

Once the water boils, add broccoli florets and frozen peas and cook for about 90 seconds. Once the time is up, drain the vegetables and immediately plunge them into the cold water so that they retain their beautiful colour. Place on a sieve to drain well. Lightly season with salt and pepper before adding to the salad.",

Bring them both to a gentle boil and then decrease the heat and simmer until the mixture resembles a thin syrup.

I used Thai red rice and even though it does say on the packet to cook it in 1:2 or 1:3 rice to water ratio, I only use 1:1.25 ratio, as I like my rice grains separate and not overcooked, and it works a treat. I put it in a pot with a see through lid. I let the water come to boil and then turn the heat right down (setting 2 out of 6). I check that all of the water has been absorbed by tilting the pot slightly and seeing if any water is seeping out. Once the water has been fully absorbed, I switch the heat off but KEEP THE LID ON. I set the rice aside and cook it in its own steam. It works a charm. This is how my gran taught me to cook white rice when I was little and it works great on red rice too.",

				"4. After the chickpeas come to boil, decrease the heat to low-medium and simmer the chickpeas (with a lid on) until tender. It takes about 60-75 minutes.",

				"7. Depending on the intended application of your aquafaba, you may want to reduce the liquid a little to make it more potent. I find that this is especially necessary for when you intent to use it as a binder, in vegan meatballs for example. Please remember also that the more reduced the liquid the more intense chickpea flavour will be so when you intent to use it for desserts, like meringues or chocolate mousse, you do not need to reduce as much or at all. To reduce aquafaba, return the remaining cooking water to the stove. Set the heat to low-medium and reduce aquafaba (without a lid) for about 30-45 minutes until some of the water evaporates and you are left with thick yellow liquid.",
				"8. Let the reduced liquid come to room temperature and then transfer to a clean container and store in the fridge \u2013 once chilled aquafaba will turn gelatinous and resemble an egg white. If you are not in a rush to use your aquafaba, pop cooked chickpeas back into the container with aquafaba and store them together overnight \u2013 this will make aquafaba even more gelatinous. Store in an air-tight container for 3-4 days."

Switch the appliance on and start trickling in cold aquafaba. You need to add enough to enable your blender to churn the mixture without any issues (hummus thickens as it rests so do not panic if it seems like a lot of liquid). In order to help the motor work the thick mixture, make small circles with the tip of your spatula/or a knife (in the direction of turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture (do not dip the spatula deeper than literally a few millimetres or else you will damage the blades). This will help to burst an air pocket under the surface and helps the motor to churn. You can also use a food processor but in my experience the hummus will be less smooth.",

				"1. To prepare the stock, chuck all the broth ingredients into a large pot (with a lid) with 10 cups / 2\u00bd litres of water. To intensify the flavour, I charred fennel and onion (cut in half) on a griddle pan. I brushed cut side with a little oil before pressing it into the hot pan to achieve a nice caramelisation. This is an optional step, but I reckon it gives the broth an extra depth of flavour. Put the lid on and bring the stock to a gentle boil and then simmer for about 60 minutes. Once cooled, put the broth through a sieve squeezing all the goodness out of the cooked vegetables. Do not throw away kombu or dried mushrooms, just chop them into smaller pieces and set aside.",
				"2. Cut your tofu into equal size pieces. Place them in a shallow dish and marinate in some soy sauce (or tamari). After a few minutes, flip them to the other side to make sure it\u2019s seasoned evenly.",
				"3. Combine 2 tbsp of frying oil with 2 tsp of sesame oil and 2 tsp of soy sauce and brush sweet potato slices, mushrooms and broccoli with it. Heat up a griddle pan and cook vegetables on a hot griddle pan in batches. Alternatively, you could bake your sweet potato slices and broccoli in the oven and saut\u00e9 your mushrooms in a pan. If you go down that route, heat up your oven to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F, spread sweet potato and broccoli on a tray ensuring that individual pieces aren\u2019t touching each other and bake broccoli for about 10-15 mins and potatoes for 20 mins. To saut\u00e9 mushrooms, heat up 1 tbsp of oil in a small pan, chuck in sliced mushrooms and saut\u00e9 on a medium heat until soft and lightly caramelised. Season with soy sauce to taste.",
				"4. If frying tofu, remove it from the marinade and sprinkle with a little cornstarch. Fry in 1-2 tbsp of hot oil (I used peanut) until golden on both sides. Blot on a piece of kitchen towel. You could also bake it, in which case skip cornflour and spread marinated tofu on a paper-lined baking tray and bake it in a 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F oven for about 30-40 mins, flipping once half way through the baking.",
				"5. Cook your noodles almost al dente according to the instructions on the packet. It\u2019s worth undercooking them a touch as they when they get immersed in a steaming hot broth they\u2019ll soften a little more.",
				"6. Put the bowls into a warm oven to heat them up for serving.",
				"7. Start warming up the broth. Season it with soy sauce, miso, vinegar, mirin and a touch of raw garlic and a few extra slices of ginger. Warm it up gently, you want to serve it hot but do not let it come to boil.",
				"8. Place a cluster of noodles, a few bits of tofu, sweet potato, broccoli and mushrooms a bit of shredded kombu and dried mushrooms in each soup bowl. Pour hot soup on top. Garnish with sliced spring onions, sesame seeds and chilli oil if you like your vegan ramen spicy. Tuck in while it\u2019s nice and hot!"

				"7. Drag each piece of vegetable in a little flour first and then immerse it in cold batter.",
				"8. Once the oil comes to temperature, test it by dropping a piece of tempura in it. If the tempura drops to the bottom but comes up right after that, the oil is at the correct temperature. If the vegetables do not drop to the bottom at all, the oil is too hot. Depending on the size of your pot and vegetables, fry 2-3 pieces at a time. It is important not to overcrowd the pan or else you\u2019ll end up with greasy tempura.",

Cook tempura for 1-2 minutes (depending on thickness and hardness of the vegetables \u2013 courgette cooks quicker than butternut squash, for example) and then turn and cook for another 1-2 minutes \u2013 until both sides are lightly browned. Once they achieve the desired colour, fish them out with a slotted spoon and place them on a piece of paper towel to drain any excess oil.",

				"1. Heat up olive oil in a large frying pan.",
				"2. Throw in garlic and stir-fry it on low-medium heat until it softens and becomes fragrant.",
				"3. Chuck in tinned tomatoes. If using plum tomatoes squash them with a potato masher first before adding to the pan. Now add stock or water (I tend to rinse my tins out with it to get all the tomato goodness out), add 1 tsp of salt and chilli and simmer (without a lid) on a low heat for about 45-60 minutes giving it a good stir every 10-15 minutes. You want the tomatoes to break down fully and the sauce to thicken so that it coats your pasta nicely.",
				"4. Towards the end of cooking time, add a large spring of fresh basil and submerge it in the sauce to release its beautiful aroma. Season the sauce with sugar (to neutralise citric acid used to preserve the tomatoes), pepper and more salt if needed. You can also add a bit more olive oil if you want it to be richer.",
				"5. If you want your sauce to be smooth, transfer it into a blender and give it a good whiz. I usually skip this step as I don\u2019t mind my sauce a little chunky.",
				"6. Mix the sauce into freshly cooked pasta. Serve with a few olives and a sprinkle of wanuts, lemon zest and fresh parsley."

Wrap it in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 mins.",
						"2. Remove the dough from the fridge and divide into 10 portions. Roll each portion out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a rough circle, about 2 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over the ramekin and gently line the inside of the ramekin with it. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife. Pierce the bottom of the ramekin with a fork a few times and put the first ramekin into the fridge. Repeat with the remaining ramekins / moulds.",
						"3. Chill all the pastry-lined ramekins in the fridge for about 60 mins.",

If using sugar instead of maple syrup, add about 4 tablespoons of sugar into the pot and allow it to melt in. Taste the mixture and add more sugar if necessary \u2013 remember that you\u2019ll probably want your curd to retain some tang to contrast with the sweet meringue nicely.",
						"3. Mix 2 tsp of cornflour with 1 tbsp of water in a small bowl and add this mixture to the warm lemon curd mixture. Bring the mixture to the boil gently (stirring the whole time) and allow it to bubble for two minutes to let it thicken (the mixture will thicken further as it cools).",

						"2. To test if whipped chickpea water\u00a0is ready, gently turn the bowl upside down. If the mixture does not start sliding down, you can start adding sugar. Otherwise, keep on whipping until the mixture stays in the bowl when inverted.",
						"3. Add sugar gradually, tablespoon by tablespoon, whipping well after each addition. By the time you\u2019ve used up all your sugar the mixture should turn beautifully sticky and glossy \u2013 no different to an egg-based meringue, really."

They may also need rotating after a minute if your oven burns a bit hotter at the back, like mine does. Alternatively you can use a blow torch if you own one.",
						"4. Let meringue pies stand for at least an hour after toasting the meringue so that it stabilises. Consume on the day \u2013 I had some of mine the next day and they were still nice but definitely nicer on the day they were made."

Once first batch is golden brown, remove it from the pan and place it an a piece of kitchen towel to drain the excess oil off. Continue with the remaining 3 batches. If you want to bake your tofu instead, heat up the oven to 180\u00ba C / 360\u00ba F and spread tofu pieces on a baking tray.

				"5. Once you finish frying the tofu, wipe the wok with a piece of kitchen towel (be careful as it will be hot) to get rid of any cornflour residue.

If you can, make the filling a day in advance as it gives all the flavours a chance to marry up and makes the filling taste better.",
				"3. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be about 1-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough the tastier the dumplings. With an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place a heaped teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of each circle and seal the dough over the filling at the top. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely.Put the finished dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.",
				"4. Heat up a little peanut oil in a lidded frying pan. Once the oil is hot, place as many potstickers as you can on the pan without them touching each other. Fry for 2 minutes, then add a splash of water to the pan (1 cm) and put the lid on. Let the dumplings cook in their own steam for about 6-8 minutes \u2013 depending on how thin your dough is. Once all the water has cooked out, take the lid off and leave the potstickers on heat for another minute or two so that the bottom is nice and crispy.",

						"3. There is a chance that once you add coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup / 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, you can always reduce it gently again.",

						"1. Dust your work surface with a little flour. Divide proofed dough into six equal pieces. Press first piece down to get rid of air pockets. Roll the dough into a long rectangle so that the shorter edge runs perpendicular to the work surface. The thinner the dough the better, but do not over do it \u2013 it should not be so thin that beetroot filling bleeds through it.",
						"2. Place a layer of beetroot slices in the middle of the rectangle so that you can close the parcel by pulling left and right sides of the rectangle up. On top of the beetroots, sprinkle some walnuts, then put a layer of horseradish cream and another layer of beetroot on top.",
						"3. Close the dough by folding the sides over the filling and pinching both ends together in the middle of the parcel. If there is too much overlap, trim the dough a little as you want to minimise the area with a double layer of pastry. Seal the ends well.",
						"4. Heat up a griddle or a non-stick pan. First brush the\u00a0g\u00f6zleme with a little bit of olive oil and place (oiled side down) on a hot pan. Brush the other side with oil and after a minute or so, flip the parcel. Press the parcel down where there are any seams as they\u2019ll need more time to cook. I also like to brown the sides by holding the parcel perpendicularly to the pan with a pair of kitchen tongs. Repeat steps 7-10 with the rest of the dough and filling."

						"2. Once all the chocolate has melted, it will need to reach 115-120\u00b0 F / 46-48\u00b0 C. Keep an eye on it the whole time and take it off the simmering water when it is nearly at temperature \u2013 the temperature will continue to rise slightly due to temperature\u2019s momentum.",
						"3. Now we need to reduce chocolate\u2019s temperature to 81\u00b0 F / 27\u00b0 C. First, mix the remaining 25 g of chocolate in until it melts completely. Place the bowl full of melted chocolate in another bowl full of cold water with a few ice cubes in it. Take the bowl out of the cold water slightly before it reaches the desired temperature 81\u00b0 F / 27\u00b0 C as the temperature will continue to drop.",
						"4. Once the chocolate has reached 81\u00b0 F / 27\u00b0 C, it\u2019s time to heat it up again. Return it to the pot with hot water and put\u00a0the hob onto the lowest setting again.

						"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.",
						"3. There is a chance that once you add coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup / 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, place the pan back on the stove an reduce the caramel gently to thicken the sauce."

			],
			"time": "0 min",
			"serving": "makes 4 portions",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Chop or break the chocolate into smaller chunks and place it in a glass or metal bowl. Place the bowl over the water bath and allow the chocolate to heat up very SLOWLY and make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl (that\u2019s important as chocolate is very sensitive to high temperatures). Once the the water barely just starts to simmer, switch the heat off. Once chocolate looks melted, give it a gentle stir (dark chocolate is sensitive to overstirring). Take the bowl off the heat and allow the chocolate to cool down \u2013 you want it as cool as possible but still liquid.",
				"2. Open your tin of chickpeas and drain the chickpea water into large glass bowl. Aquafaba should not be cold as it will make chocolate seize when added. The bowl and the utensils you\u2019ll use to whip aquafaba need to be completely grease-free as even the tiniest grease residue can prevent aquafaba from reaching stiff peaks.",
				"3. Add acid (neutral vinegar, lemon or lime juice) to the chickpea water to stablise the aquafaba. If using aquafaba from homecooked chickpeas, I also like to add a small pinch of salt \u2013 it helps to reach stiff peaks and reinforces chocolate flavour.",
				"4. Using an electric egg whisk, whip the chickpea water into stiff peaks \u2013 this is SUPER important as otherwise your mousse will deflate completely once the chocolate has been added. The best way to check if you have achieved stiff peaks is to invert the bowl with whipped aquafaba. If aquafaba slides down even a tiny bit, you are not there yet \u2013 keep on whipping until it does not move at all. I used an old, hand-held whisk and it took me about 10 minutes to get stiff peaks.\u00a0If you are a lucky owner of a stand mixer, it will happen quicker. The good news is that (as opposed to egg whites) aquafaba cannot be overwhipped.",
				"5. OPTIONAL Once you reach stiff peaks, start adding sugar, bit by bit, whipping the whole time. If sugar has caused the stiff peaks to perish, whip the mixture until you get stiff peaks again. Caster (also known as superfine) sugar or icing sugar are preferred. Other sugars are known to make aquafaba deflate too much.",
				"6. Check that the chocolate has cooled down sufficiently \u2013 it should not be warm to the touch or else chocolate is likely to seize and you will end up with grainy mousse.",
				"7. Gently and gradually fold a portion (approx. a quarter) of melted chocolate into whipped aquafaba (or whipped aquafaba into the melted chocolate \u2013 I\u2019ve heard claims that it stops chocolate from seizing, but I haven\u2019t noticed any difference personally) \u2013 using a silicone spatula and a gentle folding motion. Continue adding the chocolate to the aquafaba in small increments until all of it has been incorporated. Do not worry if your fluffy mixture deflates a bit once all of the chocolate has been added \u2013 that\u2019s perfectly normal \u2013 but you should still see plenty micro bubbles in the mixture. By the time you\u2019ve added all of your melted chocolate, the mousse MAY have more of a pourable than spoonable consistency \u2013 that\u2019s ok.",
				"8. Add chilli powder if using and mix well. Divide the mixture between 4 glasses. Gently stir the mixture between putting it into individual glasses as a bit of melted chocolate tends to drop to the bottom sometimes. Once in glass, give the mousses a gentle stir with a toothpick to ensure the mixture sets evenly.",
				"9. Put glasses into the fridge overnight for the mousse to set."

				"1. Prepare flax eggs by mixing flax meal with water (it  uses less water than traditionally prepared flax egg). Put into the fridge to chill while you get on with the other stuff.",
				"2. Pre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line 20 cm x 20 cm \u00a0/ 8 inch x 8 inch baking tin with baking parchment. Make the baking parchment stick out of the tin so that you\u2019re able to remove the brownies from the tin as soon as they are out of the oven to stop them from\u00a0cooking any further.",
				"3. Weigh your flour, add baking soda and whisk the two together with a hand egg whisk. Set aside.",
				"4. Chop your chocolate very finely. Put it into a big mixing bowl, with cacao and salt. Stir well.",
				"5. Brew an espresso. In a small pot boil water\u00a0(50 ml for tall brownies, 35 for flatter ones) +\u00a0add 2\u00a0tbsp of hot espresso. Bring both to boil.",
				"6. Pour boiling water &\u00a0espresso into the chocolate, cacao and salt mixture. Stir with a spoon so that chocolate melts in hot liquid. Don\u2019t add any more water.",
				"7. Add in sugar, flax egg (by this time it should turn all sticky) and olive oil. Using a hand mixer, blend the mixture until it\u2019s smooth. Add hazelnut liqueur\u00a0and blend it into the mixture.",
				"8. It\u2019s time to add flour and the baking soda mixture. Add little at a time and stir it into the chocolate mixture with a spoon. Do not be tempted to use an electric mixer as it will overwork the batter. Be careful not to overwork the batter or else gluten will develop in the flour and it will affect the texture of the brownies negatively. Stir just enough until there are no flour pockets anymore, but no more than that.",
				"9. Spoon the\u00a0batter (it will be rather thick) into a baking tray. Smooth it with a spatula and sprinkle chopped hazelnuts on top. Bake on middle shelf for about 23-25 minutes (taller version \u2013 I baked mine for 23 minutes) and 19-22 minutes (flatter version) depending how set\u00a0you like your brownies. The top should be nice and crispy, but the inside gooey."

				"3. If you\u2019re using regular tomatoes, deseed them before chopping. Chop tomatoes into fine dice. Add in chilli flakes, lime juice and sliced spring onion. Season with salt, pepper and sugar (if using). Set aside for the flavours to mingle.",
				"4. Put a kettle on to get hot water for your tortillas. To make tortillas mix flour, baking powder and salt in a big bowl. Add olive oil to the flour mixture and incorporate it well with your hands. Once water is ready, add it in. Initially mix it all together with a spoon as the mixture will be too hot, then start kneading it (in the bowl) with your hand. Knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Rest the dough for about 30-45 mins covered with a wet kitchen towel. The resting step is very important so do not skip it.",
				"5. To make re-fried black beans, mash cooked beans using a potato masher (or a food processor). I like mine with some whole beans left in, but the consistency is up to you. Heat up olive oil in a pan. Fry onion until translucent, add in garlic and fry for another minute. Add in spices and fry for another minute. Add in crushed beans, salt, lime juice and 1 cup of water or stock. Simmer gently until most moisture has cooked out and the mixture has thickened \u2013 you can have it looser (add more water) or thicker \u2013 again consistency is up to you. I don\u2019t like mine too watery as it makes the burrito go soggy.",
				"6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a ball and leave for another 10 minutes under a wet kitchen towel.",
				"7. Mash avocados with a fork, season with lime juice, salt and pepper and set aside.",
				"8. Now, it\u2019s time to finish the tortillas. Set a large pan on a medium heat (it\u2019s important not to get the pan too hot, if your tortilla is getting dark brown spots very quickly it means that the pan is too hot). Set another pan on the lowest heat and dampen a kitchen towel \u2013 this set-up is needed to keep tortillas warm and supple. Start rolling out tortillas on a lightly floured surface. Refrain from adding too much flour as it will produce dry tortillas. Once you are happy with the shape (they should be round*) and thickness (I roll mine quite thin), put your tortilla on a pan. Little bubbles should start to appear after about one minute. Do not wait until the bubbles go dark brown as that will make tortillas dry out too much and they\u2019ll crack later. After about 2 minutes (depends on how thick yours are) from when tortilla hit the pan, flip the tortilla and cook for only about 30 seconds on the other side. As soon as you are done, put the tortilla into the other pan and cover with damp kitchen towel. Continue the same way with all your tortillas.",
				"9. Finally, assemble your tortillas by putting chopped up lettuce, re-fried beans, salsa, rice and guacamole in the middle of the tortilla and rolling it up."

Make sure you only add the bare minimum of stock at one time \u2013 i.e. the rice isn\u2019t supposed to swim in the stock, the stock should simply make sure the rice doesn\u2019t dry out. Stir the risotto regularly, but refrain from stirring all the time as it will lower the temperature and aerate the rice.",
				"8. While topping up the risotto, heat up a griddle pan (or a regular pan). Griddle previously prepped asparagus on a hot griddle pan until nicely charred, turning a few times. Chop into 2-3 cm pieces and set aside.",
				"9. Continue adding the stock until you\u2019ve used it all up. This usually takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Cooked rice should still retain a bit of a bite. Season your risotto and add in the cooked vegetables. Put the lid on the pan and let it stand for 1\u00a0minute. Serve with the gremolata sprinkled on top."

				"2. Boil the potatoes in their skins with no salt. Make sure they are the same size, if not cut the big ones in half. Once the potatoes have been boiled put them through a potato ricer. Leave to cool.",
				"3. Open tofu, drain water off. Wrap the tofu block in a clean piece of a kitchen towel and place it on a rack with a plate underneath and something heavy (like a jam jar) on top. The point is to extract all excess moisture as you don\u2019t want the filling to be too wet.",
				"4. Mash tofu up with a fork, season with 2 tsp of soy sauce and the juice of \u00bd lemon to give it a subtle tang.",
				"5. In a bowl, combine mashed potatoes, tofu and \u00bd cup of sauteed onions. Season with salt and pepper. Leave aside.",
				"6. (DOUGH) In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add 1 cup of hot water and 1\u00bd tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually\u00a0(tablespoon by tablespoon) until you achieve the correct consistency dough. Knead it for a few minutes with your hands and then set aside for 30 minutes under\u00a0a clean kitchen towel or pierced (so that it can breathe) cling film so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
				"7. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, divide it into smaller parts (I would go with 6 portions with this much dough) and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be\u00a0about\u00a01-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough, the tastier the dumplings. With an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place a heaped teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each circle, fold the circle in half and press the edges of the semi-circle together with your fingers. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely. Put the finished\u00a0dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.",
				"8. Bring a pot of water to boil, throw\u00a0in 10 dumplings at a time and from the moment the water comes to the boil again count for 3-4 minutes (depending on how thick your dough is). Once the time is up, fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Put a new batch in\u00a0until you have cooked\u00a0them all.",
				"9. Heat up a little olive oil in a pan and place the cooled-down dumplings in the pan. Turn them after they\u2019ve browned on one side. Make sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan.",
				"10. Whilst you are frying your dumplings, warm up the rest of your sauteed onion, season it with salt and pepper and serve with your dumplings."

				"1. Set the oven to 200\u00b0 C",

Put into a hot oven and bake for 45 \u2013 60 minutes (until the beetroot is soft enough to pierce with a knife). Once baked, set the beetroots aside until they are cool enough to handle. Keep the beet juice that gathered at the bottom of each packet \u2013 it will come in useful in step 4.",

				"5. Process until smooth. If the mixture is too dry, drizzle a bit of water into it \u2013 be careful not to make it too watery. If you prefer your hummus to be smoother, transfer the mixture into a blender and process some more.\u00a0Unfortunately,\u00a0the mixture tends to get stuck in a blender (due to a blender\u2019s construction and thickness of hummus) so making it this way\u00a0is more work and I\u2019m not entirely sure it is worth the extra effort. Another thing that results in much smoother hummus is peeling chickpeas after cooking. It is an arduous task, however, so don\u2019t do it unless you are a smooth hummus fanatic.",
				"6. Adjust seasoning to taste.\u00a0Serve with fresh bread and as a part of a mezze selection."

If using unpeeled nuts, roast them for a bit longer. Once ready, put them into a clean kitchen towel and rub them against each other so that skins become loose and come off more easily. Don\u2019t worry if there are a few stubborn ones with skin left on.",

				"3. Once hazelnuts have cooled down, put them into a food processor and process until the nuts release their natural oil and the mixture reaches a smooth consistency. Don\u2019t be discouraged if it looks like it won\u2019t happen; it will. This really depends on how powerful your food processor is and it may take some time. The mixture goes through various stages (see the picture in this post), make sure to stop the processor now and then and scrape the mixture off the walls. If your food processor gets too warm, give it a rest for a few minutes and resume once it has cooled down.",
				"4. Once the nut butter has reached the correct consistency, add in melted chocolate, salt, vanilla seeds, espresso and sugar syrup. Process until smoothish \u2013 (you won\u2019t be able to achieve super smooth consistency unless you have a kick-arse food machine like a Vitamix) but I personally do not mind that you can see bits of ground nuts. It makes it more rustic and real.",
				"5. Once you add chocolate to the mix, it may seem like the mixture has gone funny, it all bunches up again into a glistening mass. Don\u2019t worry, at this point add a bit of water, a little at a time and keep on processing until the mixture loosens up a bit. Some recipes out there use coconut oil to make the mixture more creamy, for example, but I find it unnecessary given that nuts have so much oil in them already.",
